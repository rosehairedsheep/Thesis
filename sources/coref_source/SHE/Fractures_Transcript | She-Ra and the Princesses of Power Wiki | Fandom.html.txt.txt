Shadow Weaver says: "Maintain the connection."
Shadow Weaver says: "That's right."
Shadow Weaver says: "Stay focused."
Double Trouble says: "Does this usually take so long?"
Double Trouble says: "I never require this much rehearsal."
Double Trouble says: "Maybe sorcery just isn't your calling."
Shadow Weaver says: "Do not allow them to distract you."
Glimmer says: "I did it."
Glimmer says: "I mean, of course I did."
Glimmer says: "It's a truth spell."
Glimmer says: "Don't bother fighting it."
Glimmer says: "Just tell me everything you know about the Horde's plans."
Double Trouble says: "Yes."
Double Trouble says: "I can resist no longer."
Double Trouble says: "I shall tell you the truth."
Double Trouble says: "The truth is..."
Double Trouble says: "that outfit really isn't working for you."
Double Trouble says: "Oh, and magic isn't either."
Double Trouble says: "Aw."
Double Trouble says: "Your little spell failed."
Double Trouble says: "You believed my performance, though."
Double Trouble says: "I can tell."
Double Trouble says: "It's called acting."
Double Trouble says: "That's the real magic here."
Glimmer says: "Ugh."
Bright Moon Guard says: "Adora has returned and called a meeting of the Princess Alliance."
Glimmer says: "Adora's back?"
Double Trouble says: "Adora called a meeting?"
Double Trouble says: "Can she do that?"
Double Trouble says: "I thought you were the queen."
Adora* says: "I guess I should be working on my Adora impression."
Adora* says: "She's clearly the leader here."
Adora* says: "Hmm."
Adora* says: "Is the hair poof high enough?"
Theme Song.
Perfuma says: "That's really going to happen?"
Perfuma says: "To Etheria?"
Perfuma says: "To-- To us?"
Bow says: "The Heart of Etheria nearly destroyed everyone in Mara's time."
Bow says: "And it's gotten stronger, more volatile over the centuries."
Bow says: "If it goes off now..."
Bow says: "We have to make sure it never goes off again."
Frosta says: "So, how do we stop it?"
Shadow Weaver says: "Stop it?"
Shadow Weaver says: "The real question is how do you intend to use this to your advantage?"
Adora says: "Uh, we're not."
Adora says: "You saw the simulation."
Adora says: "We have to disable it."
Shadow Weaver says: "And throw away such power?"
Shadow Weaver says: "Perhaps the First Ones were fools for storing so much raw energy at the heart of the planet."
Shadow Weaver says: "But now that it's there..."
Glimmer says: "What if there was a way to channel that magic ourselves?"
Shadow Weaver says: "The princesses are powerful, but with that magic they would be unstoppable."
Glimmer says: "We'd be supercharged."
Glimmer says: "We could take down the Horde."
Adora says: "Are you seriously considering this?"
Adora says: "You heard Bow."
Adora says: "It's an unstable superweapon."
Adora says: "Tampering with it is way too dangerous."
Glimmer says: "Dangerous?"
Glimmer says: "Every day, the Horde claims more territory."
Glimmer says: "We're running out of options."
Glimmer says: "So I say we get Light Hope to tell us how it works, and take our power back."
Adora says: "All she wants is to set the weapon off."
Adora says: "Are you even listening to us?"
Bow says: "Okay."
Bow says: "Five-minute break."
Catra says: "Finally."
Catra says: "What are you doing?"
Lonnie says: "We just got back."
Lonnie says: "The Eastern Quadrant is secured."
Lonnie says: "No rebel activity."
Catra says: "While you were out in the field, did you see anyone?"
Catra says: "Anything else?"
Lonnie says: "Just lots of tired soldiers."
Catra says: "Get back out there, then."
Lonnie says: "Catra, we already worked a double."
Lonnie says: "We've been going without R and R for days now."
Lonnie says: "We need sleep."
Catra says: "Oh, I'm sorry, are you tired?"
Catra says: "We're all tired, but we're not going to rest until we have all of Etheria under our control."
Catra says: "Everything is finally coming together."
Catra says: "We're winning."
Catra says: "So, get back out there."
Catra says: "Problem?"
Glimmer says: "Lost a lot?"
Glimmer says: "Elberon, Thaymor, Alwyn, Salineas."
Glimmer says: "We've lost almost everything."
Glimmer says: "This magic is the only thing that can help us save everyone."
Perfuma says: "Use the scary magical energy."
Perfuma says: "Don't use the scary magical energy."
Frosta says: "Maybe we should continue this in the morning?"
Frosta says: "Not that I'm up past my bedtime."
Frosta says: "I don't have a bedtime."
Frosta says: "I can go to bed whenever I want."
Mermista says: "Or we can just decide right now."
Mermista says: "I'll do whatever it takes to get my kingdom back."
Mermista says: "I say we use the magic."
Perfuma says: "Oh, it's so dangerous."
Perfuma says: "What if it goes off in the process?"
Perfuma says: "Oh, I don't know."
Perfuma says: "Just come back to me."
Perfuma says: "Use the scary magic or don't use the scary magic."
Swift Wind says: "How come I still don't have a chair even though the new person does?"
Scorpia says: "Oh, no."
Scorpia says: "I'm sitting on Emily."
Adora says: "Swift Wind, is this really the time to..."
Adora says: "?"
Glimmer says: "Uh..."
Scorpia says: "Hey, everybody."
Scorpia says: "How are you?"
Scorpia says: "Gosh, I am so sorry for popping in unannounced."
Scorpia says: "I didn't wanna interrupt."
Frosta says: "Horde soldier!"
Adora says: "For the honor of Grayskull!"
Scorpia says: "No."
Scorpia says: "Do-- Hold on!"
Scorpia says: "Hold on!"
Scorpia says: "I don't wanna fight you."
Perfuma says: "She's got a bot!"
Mermista says: "For Salineas!"
Scorpia says: "Wait!"
Frosta says: "You ruined Princess Prom!"
Scorpia says: "No, wait!"
Scorpia says: "Wat, wait, wait!"
Scorpia says: "No."
Scorpia says: "Please!"
Scorpia says: "I don't wanna hurt you."
Scorpia says: "I am so sorry."
Scorpia says: "I did not mean to do that."
Scorpia says: "It's instinct."
Scorpia says: "It--Uh-oh."
Scorpia says: "Please!"
Scorpia says: "I need your help to save Entrapta!"
Catra says: "Scorpia?"
Lonnie says: "Okay, no."
Catra says: "What are they saying?"
Lonnie says: "What?"
Lonnie says: "Who?"
Catra says: "Don't pretend like you don't know."
Catra says: "Are they laughing at me?"
Lonnie says: "Mostly people are just tired."
Lonnie says: "I think if you let them sleep, everything will be fine."
Catra says: "Everything isn't fine."
Catra says: "Scorpia would be here if everything was fine."
Scorpia says: "Again, I am so sorry about the whole stinging thing."
Glimmer says: "All right, Horde soldier."
Scorpia says: "Hmm?"
Glimmer says: "Why are you here?"
Glimmer says: "Heh."
Glimmer says: "Are you listening to me?"
Scorpia says: "Wow..."
Scorpia says: "Yeah, but just-- Shadow Weaver."
Scorpia says: "And at Bright Moon."
Scorpia says: "Everything is making so much sense about why Catra's been acting the way she has."
Scorpia says: "And now I left."
Scorpia says: "Oh, that's gonna do a real number on her."
Adora says: "Hey."
Adora says: "Answer the question."
Scorpia says: "Right."
Scorpia says: "Sorry."
Scorpia says: "The thing is you all seem really good at friendship."
Perfuma says: "You're here to learn how to be a good friend?"
Scorpia says: "Yes."
Scorpia says: "That's it."
Scorpia says: "See, I thought I was being a good friend to Catra, but it turns out Catra wasn't being a good friend to me, and also that I have no idea what friendship is."
Scorpia says: "Man, I think Entrapta's the only real friend I've ever had."
Scorpia says: "Oh."
Scorpia says: "And Emily."
Mermista says: "Say things that make sense."
Scorpia says: "Right."
Scorpia says: "Okay."
Scorpia says: "Entrapta wanted to warn Hordak about the whole, you know, portal weirdness thing, so Catra sent her to Beast Island, and I..."
Scorpia says: "I let it happen."
Scorpia says: "Now I have to save her."
Adora says: "Beast Island?"
Adora says: "With the blood beetles?"
Adora says: "And the trees with razor-sharp blades instead of leaves?"
Adora says: "It's real?"
Shadow Weaver says: "Oh, yes."
Shadow Weaver says: "But it's much worse than that."
Shadow Weaver says: "We told you those children's stories so you wouldn't be scared."
Scorpia says: "It's worse?"
Scorpia says: "Oh, what have I done?"
Adora says: "We can't leave her there."
Bow says: "If we wanna safely disable the weapon, Entrapta's our best bet."
Bow says: "She'd know more about that than anyone."
Adora says: "We have to get to Beast Island right away, save Entrapta, and shut down the Heart of Etheria for good."
Glimmer says: "Hold on."
Swift Wind says: "I'm in."
Glimmer says: "No, you're not-- What?"
Scorpia says: "Me, too."
Scorpia says: "Obviously, I mean, I brought this to you."
Adora says: "Great, then it's decided."
Glimmer says: "Will everyone just stop for one second?"
Glimmer says: "You aren't going anywhere."
Glimmer says: "You're our prisoner."
Glimmer says: "And you!"
Glimmer says: "We need to talk about this."
Glimmer says: "Now!"
Glimmer says: "Stop it."
Glimmer says: "Stop just trying to barrel ahead with your own plans."
Glimmer says: "We have to talk about this."
Adora says: "What's there to talk about?"
Adora says: "Entrapta needs our help, and we need Entrapta."
Glimmer says: "Adora, have you ever heard of anyone coming back from Beast Island?"
Glimmer says: "Do you even know where it is?"
Adora says: "No."
Adora says: "But we have to try."
Glimmer says: "Oh, great plan."
Glimmer says: "The Horde's on our doorstep and we'll just drop everything to run off on a harebrained rescue mission."
Bow says: "Glimmer, you do want to save Entrapta, right?"
Glimmer says: "Of course I do."
Glimmer says: "We'll save her."
Glimmer says: "But we need to stop the Horde first."
Glimmer says: "I won't risk the whole Alliance for one princess who betrayed us."
Bow says: "There's an unstable mass of magic in the middle of the planet."
Bow says: "Everyone's at risk unless we can get Entrapta to shut it down."
Glimmer says: "Entrapta has a habit of exploding everything she touches."
Glimmer says: "You really wanna let her near this thing?"
Glimmer says: "Just go to Light Hope and ask her."
Glimmer says: "If we can get some of that stored power back, we could use it to defeat the Horde and save Entrapta."
Adora says: "What?"
Adora says: "No."
Adora says: "I told you, we can't trust her."
Adora says: "She betrayed Mara."
Adora says: "She lied to me."
Adora says: "She's the bad guy!"
Glimmer says: "The Horde are the bad guys."
Glimmer says: "And you don't have to tell her everything."
Glimmer says: "Just find out how it works and how to access it."
Adora says: "And if it goes wrong?"
Adora says: "People could get hurt."
Glimmer says: "Bow."
Glimmer says: "You understand what I'm trying to say, tell her."
Bow says: "No."
Bow says: "You weren't there."
Bow says: "We need Entrapta."
Bow says: "We need to disable the weapon."
Glimmer says: "Why can't you just trust me in this?"
Bow says: "Because you're wrong!"
Glimmer says: "You think I'm wrong?"
Glimmer says: "Fine."
Glimmer says: "But I am still queen."
Glimmer says: "And as queen I am ordering you."
Glimmer says: "No one is going to Beast Island."
Glimmer says: "You're not to set foot outside the castle unless I say so."
Glimmer says: "End of discussion."
Scorpia says: "Oh."
Scorpia says: "Ha, ha."
Scorpia says: "Hang--Hang on."
Scorpia says: "I get to stay here?"
Frosta says: "This is the only other spare room we have."
Frosta says: "But don't go thinking it's a sleepover."
Frosta says: "We're guarding you."
Perfuma says: "I brought snacks."
Perfuma says: "Thought you might be hungry after your journey."
Scorpia says: "Okay."
Scorpia says: "What is that?"
Scorpia says: "Why is it green and not bar-shaped?"
Scorpia says: "Are you trying to poison me?"
Scorpia says: "And if not, why are you being so nice?"
Perfuma says: "It's green because it's a vegetable, silly."
Perfuma says: "Do they not have those in the Horde?"
Perfuma says: "Oh."
Perfuma says: "Well, okay, you should definitely be eating them."
Perfuma says: "And we're being nice because you're our guest."
Frosta says: "Prisoner."
Perfuma says: "I'll get pillows."
Perfuma says: "Be right back."
Perfuma says: "Aah!"
Scorpia says: "Oh."
Scorpia says: "Mm-mm."
Scorpia says: "Blah, blah, blah."
Scorpia says: "Wh-- What?"
Frosta says: "How strong are your pincers?"
Frosta says: "Can you crush things or just cut?"
Scorpia says: "Oh, you know, they're good for general pincing."
Scorpia says: "And cutting through basically everything."
Frosta says: "Really?"
Frosta says: "I gotta try that."
Frosta says: "Oh."
Frosta says: "Are you--?"
Frosta says: "Are you crying?"
Frosta says: "Is it because I made ice pincers?"
Frosta says: "I'm sorry."
Frosta says: "They're your thing."
Frosta says: "I get it."
Scorpia says: "No, it's not that."
Scorpia says: "The Horde always told me I was different, that I wouldn't fit in with you at all, but you're making me feel the opposite of not belonging, which I guess is belonging?"
Frosta says: "I used to feel that way, too."
Frosta says: "And then I met Glimmer and the others, and I realized that none of us fit in."
Frosta says: "We're all different, but that's okay."
Scorpia says: "That might be the nicest thing anyone's ever said to me."
Frosta says: "Well, don't get used to it."
Frosta says: "You're still our prisoner."
Frosta says: "But I've got first watch, so I'll be up, if you wanna talk more."
Hordak says: "I've taken the last of the coastal towns."
Hordak says: "What is the status in the Woods?"
Catra says: "Our raiding parties have crushed the villages near our current outpost."
Catra says: "Tomorrow, we move farther inland."
Catra says: "Everything is under control."
Hordak says: "Excellent."
Hordak says: "Etheria will be ours yet."
Bow says: "I've never lied to Glimmer before."
Bow says: "I mean, it's not "lying" lying."
Bow says: "I left a note."
Bow says: "Three, actually."
Bow says: "But still."
Adora says: "We're doing the right thing."
Adora says: "We can't let what happened in Mara's time ever happen again."
Adora says: "And Glimmer's gonna be angry at us, but at least she'll be around to be angry."
Bow says: "Do you think I should leave another note?"
Adora says: "Uh, Bow."
Adora says: "We're kind of sneaking out here."
Adora says: "You think you could keep it down a little?"
Bow says: "Sorry."
Swift Wind says: "Hey, Adora!"
Swift Wind says: "I kicked open the last barn door I could and I am ready to go!"
Adora says: "Swifty, you gotta keep it down."
Frosta says: "What's happening?"
Bow says: "Uh..."
Bow says: "You're asleep?"
Bow says: "Yeah, you're asleep."
Bow says: "This is a dream."
Bow says: "A dream."
Swift Wind says: "Yes."
Swift Wind says: "The flying unicorn dream."
Swift Wind says: "Classic."
Frosta says: "I know what you're doing."
Frosta says: "And you better hurry."
Adora says: "You're--?"
Adora says: "You're not gonna stop us?"
Frosta says: "I didn't join the Princess Alliance just to fight."
Frosta says: "I joined to save people."
Frosta says: "And the Horde, even after everything they did..."
Frosta says: "they're people, just like us."
Frosta says: "I'll cover for you, but you have to go now."
Frosta says: "Everyone will be up soon."
Adora says: "Should I be doing anything or..."
Adora says: "?"
Bow says: "Um..."
Bow says: "Not sure."
Bow says: "Gonna be honest, I've never flown a spaceship."
Swift Wind says: "I know how to fly."
Swift Wind says: "Just have this thing flap its wings."
Swift Wind says: "There's gotta be a flapping wings button."
Bow says: "No, no, no!"
Swift Wind says: "Never mind, that wasn't it."
Swift Wind says: "Down's the opposite of the direction we want to go in!"
Bow says: "We know that, Swift Wind!"
Adora says: "Bow!"
Adora says: "Do something!"
Swift Wind says: "Loop-de-loops!"
Swift Wind says: "How could you betray me?"
Darla says: "Administrator detected."
Darla says: "What is your query?"
Adora says: "Fly ship!"
Adora says: "How to fly ship."
Bow says: "Just take us back down gently!"
Darla says: "Acknowledged."
Darla says: "Going in reverse."
Bow says: "No, no, no!"
Adora says: "Stop!"
Darla says: "Please state navigational course."
Adora says: "Uh..."
Adora says: "Beast Island?"
Darla says: "Setting coordinates for Hazardous Materials Disposal Site."
Darla says: "Designation, Beast Island."
Darla says: "Coordinates set."
Darla says: "Is any additional assistance required?"
Adora says: "Can you maybe fly us there?"
Darla says: "Affirmative."
Darla says: "Setting autopilot."
Bow says: "Wow."
Bow says: "That was a lot easier than I thought it'd be."
Double Trouble says: "Oh, back again?"
Double Trouble says: "You know what they say, if at first you don't succeed, try, try, try."
Double Trouble says: "How many times have you tried again?"
Glimmer says: "Tell me everything."
Double Trouble says: "I--I--I can't cry on cue."
Double Trouble says: "Whenever a role calls for tears, the only thing that works is thinking about children falling."
Double Trouble says: "They're tears of laughter, but no one can tell the difference."
Double Trouble says: "I've never told anyone that before."
Glimmer says: "Tell me the Horde's plans."
Double Trouble says: "Oh, is that all?"
Double Trouble says: "Why didn't you just say so?"
Double Trouble says: "Catra and Hordak are worked up because Horde Prime is on his way with his armada."
Double Trouble says: "To conquer all of Etheria."
Glimmer says: "When?"
Double Trouble says: "Any day now, darling."
Double Trouble says: "I'd say it's curtains for your little rebellion here."
Double Trouble says: "But, hey, while this truth spell is still working, here's on more for you."
Double Trouble says: "If you're already losing to Hordak, you poor lambs don't stand a chance against Horde Prime."
Glimmer says: "No."
Glimmer says: "Adora!"
Glimmer says: "Bow!"
Shadow Weaver says: "You can still stop them."
Glimmer says: "Let them go."
Glimmer says: "If they don't trust me, I don't trust them."
Glimmer says: "Horde Prime is coming."
Glimmer says: "We need to be ready for him."
Glimmer says: "I'm gonna figure out how to access the magic at the Heart of Etheria, and how to use it."
Glimmer says: "And I'll do it alone if I have to."
