Scene opens with a closeup of Catra's eyes.
Scorpia says: "Catra."
Scorpia says: "Hey, Catra."
Scorpia says: "Boy, you are just as fast on sand as everywhere else."
Scorpia says: "Whoo!"
Scorpia says: "Ha."
Scorpia says: "Now, what are we looking at?"
Catra says: "I'm looking at the Crimson Waste."
Catra says: "The place Hordak sent me to die."
Catra says: "I have no idea what you're doing, as the last thing I told you was to leave me alone."
Scorpia says: "I know."
Scorpia says: "It was so noble of you."
Scorpia says: "You pushed me away in order to save me."
Scorpia says: "And it just brought us closer together."
Catra says: "I'm not  You know what?"
Catra says: "It doesn't matter."
Catra says: "Nothing matters anymore."
Catra says: "You know what I see here?"
Catra says: "All my hard work ignored because of one mistake."
Catra says: "My dreams turning to dust in front of my eyes."
Catra says: "But mainly I'm looking at that?"
Lizard screeches as Catra nearly steps on it.
Scorpia says: "Huh."
Scorpia says: "Must be abandoned."
Scorpia says: "According to Force Captain orientation, the Crimson Waste is completely deserted."
Catra says: "Yeah, It better be."
Catra says: "I'm not in the mood to deal with – people."
Cantina full of patrons.
Scorpia says: "Or that information could be completely wrong."
Scorpia says: "Man."
Scorpia says: "Maybe I should have skipped orientation, ha, ha, you know what I mean?"
Catra groaning angrily.
Catra says: "Of course Hordak is wrong."
Bar patron spits.
Catra says: "He's a shut-in who lives in his lab and doesn't know how to do anything."
Catra says: "Why am I surprised at this?"
Catra says: "Move it."
Catra says: "I'm tired."
Four Armed Lizard Girl squeals as Catra hurls her from their stool.
Catra hisses, growls.
Scorpia says: "Hey, Catra, I'm not questioning you leadership here, but maybe we shouldn't pick on the heavily armed crowd?"
Catra says: "Oh, yeah?"
Catra says: "And what are the going to do?"
Catra says: "Send me to die in the Crimson Waste?"
Catra says: "Oh, would you look at that, I'm already here."
Horned Goon says: "Good riddance to that She-Ra girl."
Catra says: "Are you kidding me?"
Catra says: "Which way did they go?"
Horned Goon says: "Who are you?"
Catra says: "You said there was a sparkly girl, a boy with arrows, and a blonde."
Catra says: "Which way did they go?"
Horned Goon says: "Buzz off, Kitty Kitty."
Catra says: "What, are you too dumb to understand a simple question?"
Catra says: "Just point, genius, and I'll figure it out."
Scorpia says: "Hey, Catra?"
Catra says: "What?"
Scorpia says: "Last thing I remember, Hordak sent us out here to track down First Ones tech, not Adora."
Scorpia says: "So, why do we need to know which way they're going?"
Catra says: "Because Adora and her friends are always after the same thing as we are."
Catra says: "Of course they're in the middle of nowhere."
Catra says: "So, spit it out already!"
Catra says: "Where are they going?"
Horned Goon says: "There are only two rules in the Crimson Waste."
Horned Goon says: "One, the strong make the rules."
Catra says: "So, here's the thing."
Catra says: "I've done this."
Catra says: "The whole “threatening people” bit, the intimidation."
Catra says: "I've been there."
Catra says: "And I just don't care anymore."
Catra says: "Some people have a bad day."
Catra says: "If I win a fight, I lose the war."
Catra says: "Threats only work on someone who has something to lose."
Catra says: "But me?"
Horned Goon exclaims.
Catra says: "I've already lost it all."
Catra says: "And you can't be any good at this, because you just let yourself get distracted."
Four Armed Lizard Girl gasps.
Scorpia giggles.
Catra says: "so..."
Catra says: "what'll it be?"
Horned Goon says: "Hey, you know, we don't think of you as an outsider at all."
Horned Goon says: "You are okay with us."
Horned Goon says: "We'll take you anywhere you wanna go, boss."
Patron whistles.
Catra says: "Good."
Scene switches to Mara's ship with Huntara, Adora, Bow and Glimmer.
Adora says: "I can't believe I'm standing in front of Mara's ship."
Glimmer says: "How do you know this is Mara's?"
Adora says: "Light Hope showed me Mara's ship crashing."
Adora says: "Right before the stars disappeared."
Huntara says: "I don't know who Mara is, but that's definitely the ship that says your name."
Adora says: "Wait."
Adora says: "Says my name?"
Huntara says: "Not Adora."
Huntara says: "It says She-Ra."
Bow says: "This is incredible."
Bow says: "A First Ones ship?"
Bow says: "This thing used to travel through space."
Bow says: "Think of all the amazing things it contains."
Bow says: "Or it could be empty."
Bow says: "That's an option, too."
Adora says: "This can't be it."
Adora says: "Where's the message coming from then?"
Glimmer says: "Has this ship always been here?"
Huntara says: "The Crimson Waste got hit with the mother of all dust storms."
Huntara says: "And when it cleared, this was unearthed."
Bow says: "And then people stole everything they could pry up and take."
Huntara says: "Look, if they didn't want things stolen, they should have bolted everything down better."
Huntara says: "Besides, no one comes here anymore."
Glimmer says: "Because there's nothing left to steal?"
Huntara says: "Well, that."
Huntara says: "And it's haunted."
Mara's voice says: "She-Ra."
Mara's voice says: "Etheria."
Mara's voice says: "Gone."
Glimmer gasps.
Bow exclaims.
Adora says: "Where is that voice coming from?"
Adora says: "And where's the door?"
Adora says: "This ship is massive but this room is tiny."
Adora says: "There has to be a door around here somewhere."
Adora says: "Hold on."
Sword of Protection transforms to a shield thrums.
Mara's voice says: "She-Ra."
Mara's voice says: "Etheria."
Mara's voice says: "Gone."
Scene switches to Catra, Scorpia, Four Armed Lizard Girl and Horned Goon Girl.
Scorpia says: "Oh, boy, you really had them going."
Scorpia says: "I've never seen a room of murderous toughs look so freaked out before."
Scorpia says: "It was truly an honor to witness."
Catra says: "What, those washed-up hacks?"
Catra says: "They needed to be taught what happens when they try to threaten me."
Scorpia says: "Well, they won't be bothering us anymore, that's for sure."
Scorpia whacks Four Armed Lizard Girl into cacti.
Four Armed Lizard Girl grunts freezes solid.
Scorpia says: "Oh, oops, sorry."
Scorpia says: "Can you carry her again?"
Catra says: "Scorpia, you don't have to ask."
Catra says: "Carry her, idiot."
Catra says: "Move."
Catra says: "You know, I'm starting to thing this place gets a bad rap."
Scorpia says: "Oh, I'm with you."
Horned Goon Girl grunting.
Scorpia says: "It's nice and toasty."
Scorpia says: "If you look for the ground ripples you can avoid the quicksand."
Scorpia says: "And my exoskeleton is loving this dry climate."
Catra says: "And you can take whatever you want."
Catra says: "The meaner you are, the more they listen to you."
Catra says: "Give me your dart gun."
Horned Goon Girl says: "Oh!"
Horned Goon Girl says: "Uh..."
Horned Goon Girl says: "Yeah, go."
Catra says: "See?"
Scorpia laughs.

Catra and Scorpia laugh.
Scorpia says: "So, this is fun."
Catra says: "Yeah."
Catra says: "It is."
Scorpia gasps.
Catra says: "Stop it right now or I take it all back."
Scorpia says: "I'm not saying anything."
Catra says: "You're doing that thing with your face where it's obvious what you're thinking."
Scorpia says: "Do you mean smiling?"
Catra says: "We make a good team, that's it."
Scorpia says: "Right."
Scorpia says: "A good team."
Scorpia says: "That's us."
Scorpia laughs This is crazy. Are there really animals this big? Come on.
Catra says: "Not anymore."
Scorpia says: "What?"
Rocks crumble from above.
Catra says: "What are you trying to pull?"
Horned Goon Girl says: "Nothing."
Horned Goon Girl says: "What are you talking about?"
Scorpia says: "Catra, what's going on?"
Catra says: "I'll tell you what."

Hologram materializes.
Bow shouts.

Adora says: "I have so many questions for you."
Adora says: "I don't even know where to start."

Adora says: "Um..."
Adora says: "Hi?"
Adora says: "I'm Adora."
Mara's hologram says: "I am Mara, She-Ra of Etheria, and I am gone."
Huntara says: "Well, that's unsettling."
Adora says: "No."
Adora says: "No, no."
Adora says: "This isn't it."
Adora says: "I've done this before."
Adora says: "There's usually a password or something."
Mara's hologram says: "I am Mara, She-Ra of Etheria, and I am gone."
Adora says: "Eternia."
Adora says: "I have the sword."
Adora says: "I am She-Ra."
Adora says: "Administrator detected!"
Adora says: "Speak to me!"
Mara's hologram says: "I am Mara, She-Ra of Etheria, and I am gone."
Adora laughs maniacally.
Glimmer says: "Adora?"
Adora says: "Of course it's on a loop."
Adora says: "Of course it is."
Adora says: "Because why would a hologram ever give me a straight answer?"
Adora says: "Solve a puzzle."
Adora says: "Train."
Adora says: "Let go."
Adora says: "I do everything they tell me, waiting for answers, And all I'm left with is..."
Adora says: "is..."
Adora says: "Why was I taken from my family?"

Adora places sword in console which activates, another hologram of Mara.
Mara hologram says: "I don't have much time."
Mara hologram says: "I barely made it out..."

Mara hologram says: "You are the new She-Ra."
Mara hologram says: "It means I failed."

Gang member shouting.
Horned Goon Girl says: "Oh no."
Horned Goon Girl says: "It's Tung Lashor!"
Catra says: "I'm sorry, what?"
Horned Goon Girl says: "Look, Tung Lashor leads the number two gang in the Crimson Waste."
Horned Goon Girl says: "He's bee itching to push Huntara out of years and become number one."
Horned Goon Girl says: "With her gone, they'd run this place."
Tung Lashor says: "And it looks like today is our lucky, lucky day."
Tung Lashor says: "I never thought you'd be dumb enough to step foot out here without Huntara."
Tung Lashor says: "But here you are."
Tung Lashor says: "And now I'm gonna leave your bones as a warning to all who cross Tung Lashor, strongest in the Crimson Waste."
Catra says: "It sounds even stupider the second time."
Catra says: "Seriously, Tung Lashor?"
Catra says: "Pfft."
Catra says: "Which one of you came up with that?"
Scorpia says: "Right?"
Scorpia says: "It's like, what, did you lose a bet?"
Gang member laughs, then falls, thudding on the ground.
Tung Lashor says: "You done, outsider?"
Catra says: "Are you kidding?"
Catra says: "I'm just getting started."
Catra says: "First, all that “leaving your bones” talk, it's just too much."
Catra says: "I'm I'm sure around here you're considered very scary."
Tung Lashor snarls.
Catra says: "Second, they're not with Huntara anymore, they're with me."
Catra says: "And third..."
Catra says: "I like that whip."
Catra says: "I think I'll be taking it."
Tung Lashor says: "Is that so?"
Scorpia says: "Hey, do you even know how to use a whip?"
Catra says: "Can't be hard if this guy figured it out."
Tung Lashor says: "Uh..."
Scorpia says: "I think it's all in the wrist."
Scorpia says: "Ya know, like wa-pow!"
Scorpia says: "Crack!"
Scorpia says: "Whip!"
Catra says: "No, I'm not going to say 'whip' when I use the whip."
Catra says: "No one does that."
Scorpia says: "Ohh, maybe you can say a catchphrase then."
Scorpia says: "Like, uh..."
Scorpia says: "Like, whip."
Scorpia says: "I mean it's – I mean, I'm just spit-balling here."
Scorpia says: "I like, I don't know, like..."

Mara's hologram says: "I don't know what they told you, but it wasn't all bad at first."
Mara's hologram says: "We were the first ones to settle Etheria, to really study this planet's magic."
Mara's hologram says: "How could it go so wrong?"
Adora says: "What weapon?"
Adora says: "Bow, how's it going?"
Adora says: "Have you fixed it?"
Bow says: "I'm trying, but I think the message got damaged when the ship crashed."
Mara's hologram says: "I opened a portal to a completely empty dimension and pulled Etheria in."
Mara's hologram says: "I hid us from the rest of the universe to keep everyone safe."
Mara's hologram says: "This is the one place they'll never find us."
Mara's hologram says: "I saw what they would do."
Mara's hologram says: "The deaths that would follow."
Mara's hologram says: "I couldn't stop them before, but I can now."

Catra says: "They joined me."
Catra says: "Hey Adora."
Huntara grunts.
Catra says: "This might be the quickest I've ever won a fight."
Catra says: "Always so dramatic with you, isn't it, Adora?"
Huntara groans.
Adora says: "Huntara!"
Adora says: "Get them out!"

Scorpia says: "I can't."
Scorpia says: "You guys, I – Thank you."
Scorpia says: "Yes."
Scorpia says: "Gosh."
Catra says: "Can you believe this?"
Catra says: "They said this was called a “party”."
Catra says: "I like it."
Catra says: "When we go back, there's going to be a lot more parties."
Scorpia says: "Uh, the crazy desert lady got away."
Catra says: "Let her."
Catra says: "We've got the most important thing right here."
Catra says: "You heard that hologram."
Catra says: "This is the key to the whole planet."
Catra says: "When I bring this back to the Fright Zone, Hordak will see me for what I'm worth and I'll be back on top."
Scorpia says: "Or, you know, counterpoint, we don't go back at all."
Catra says: "What?"
Catra says: "Why wouldn't we go back?"
Scorpia says: "Uh..."
Scorpia says: "Because you hate it there?"
Catra says: "I don't."
Scorpia says: "Hear me out, okay?"
Scorpia says: "Within like, a day, you've defeated the gangs ruling the Crimson Waste and made yourself their leader."
Scorpia says: "This is the happiest I've ever seen you."
Scorpia says: "Scratch that."
Scorpia says: "This is the first time I've ever seen you happy, period."
Scorpia says: "So, why would we go back?"
Scorpia says: "Let's stay here."
Scorpia says: "Forget Hordak."
Scorpia says: "Forget Adora."
Scorpia says: "Forget all of them."
Scorpia says: "We could rule the Crimson Waste together, just the two of us."
Scorpia says: "We cold, you know, be happy."
Catra says: "I-- I don't – I have to go check on the prisoner."
Door clangs open.
Adora says: "Catra, you can't do this."
Catra says: "Well, hello to you, too."
Catra says: "What can't I do this time?"
Adora says: "Hordak is trying to open a portal."
Adora says: "He wants to bring the rest of the Horde army through to Etheria."
Adora says: "We can't let that happen."
Catra says: "The rest of the Horde army?"
Catra says: "Never a dull moment with you."
Catra says: "Why would I be against more Horde?"
Catra says: "That means we win and you lose."
Adora says: "We'll all lose if Hordak uses his portal machine."
Adora says: "Light Hope and Mara both said that opening a portal will endanger everyone."
Catra says: "You'll listen to anything weird old holograms tell you, won't you?"
Catra says: "You should really try to get over that."
Catra says: "Besides, how do you know about what Hordak's doing?"
Adora says: "Shadow Weaver told me."
Adora says: "We know all about Hordak's plan."
Catra says: "Shadow Weaver told you?"
Catra says: "How exactly did Shadow Weaver tell you this?"
Adora says: "You didn't know?"
Catra says: "How?"
Adora says: "Catra, Shadow Weaver is in Bright Moon."
Catra says: "Shadow Weaver left me for you."
Catra says: "All of this happened because of you."
Adora says: "Catra?"
Adora says: "Catra, please, you have to listen."
Catra murmurs.
Scorpia says: "Hey Catra."
Scorpia says: "Whoa, there."
Scorpia says: "Gotta be careful, boss."
