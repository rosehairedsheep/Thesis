Adora mumbling in her sleep.
Adora gasps.
Bow says: "Good morning Glimmer."
Glimmer says: "Noooo."
Glimmer says: "It's too early."
Glimmer says: "Five more minutes."
Bow says: "But it's a beautiful morning."
Glimmer says: "Today's cancelled."
Glimmer says: "Go back to bed."
Glimmer says: "I can feel you staring at me."
Glimmer says: "Why is it the one who snores is always the first one to fall asleep?"
Bow says: "What?"
Bow says: "I don't snore."
Bow says: "Adora, do I snore?"
Bow says: "Adora?"
Adora gasps.
Glimmer says: "Sorry, too early to teleport."
Bow says: "What are we looking at?"
Adora says: "I don't know."
Adora says: "I heard a noise in the woods last night."
Adora says: "And I thought I saw something."
Glimmer says: "What?"
Glimmer says: "Like a bunny?"
Glimmer says: "Maybe a butterfly?"
Glimmer says: "Adora, did you get any sleep at all?"
Adora says: "Someone has to stand guard."
Glimmer says: "Okay, I know you're on edge because of what happened with Entrapta's infected robots, but it's all over now."
Glimmer says: "You've got to relax."
Glimmer says: "You need a vacation."
Glimmer says: "Which is why we're going to Mystacor."
Bow says: "Mystacor?"
Bow says: "No way."
Adora says: "Wait, what's Mystacor?"
Glimmer says: "It's a secret floating kingdom that's home to all of Etheria's sorcerers."
Glimmer says: "It's got tranquil gardens, and beautiful beaches and healing springs."
Glimmer says: "And my aunt Castaspella just happens to be the head sorceress there."
Bow says: "You'll love it Adora."
Bow says: "Plus you won't have to worry about evil things in the woods."
Bow says: "Mystacor is protected by an invisibility spell, so evil can't find it."
Glimmer says: "It's the safest and most peaceful place in all of Etheria."
Glimmer says: "We'll have you relaxing in no time."
Adora says: "You know I've never relaxed in my life, right?"
Bow says: "Well, we're here to change that."
Bow says: "Just wait."
Shadow Spy hisses.
Catra says: "Shadow Weaver, you wanted to see me?"
Shadow Weaver says: "Ah."
Shadow Weaver says: "Force Captain."
Shadow Weaver says: "How kind of you to join me."
Catra says: "What's up with you?"
Catra says: "You're being spookier than usual."
Shadow Weaver says: "My shadow spies have found Adora."
Shadow Weaver says: "She's on her way to Mystacor with her new friends."
Shadow Weaver says: "Mystacor."
Shadow Weaver says: "This is going to be too easy."
Catra says: "Another Adora mission."
Catra says: "Fine."
Catra says: "When do I leave?"
Shadow Weaver says: "The only place you're headed is outside my door to stand guard."
Shadow Weaver says: "I'm going to use my magic to go after Adora myself."
Shadow Weaver says: "You will see that I am not disturbed."
Shadow Weaver says: "Clearly, no one else can be trusted to bring her back to the Horde, least of all you."
Shadow Weaver says: "Now go."
Shadow Weaver says: "I said, go!"
Catra gasps.
Shadow Weaver says: "From the farthest reaches of Etheria, I command you, be as one!"
Shadow Spy screeches.
Glimmer says: "We're here!"
Adora says: "We're on a cliff, overlooking a thousand foot drop."
Glimmer says: "Yes we are, but not for long."
Glimmer says: "Woo-hoo!"
Bow says: "Woo-hoo!"
Adora says: "Uh, guys?"
Bow says: "C'mon Adora, jump!"
Adora grunts then gasps.
Bow says: "Oh, ouch."
Bow says: "You okay?"
Adora says: "I'm fine."
Adora says: "I thought I saw--  I'm just stressed."
Glimmer says: "Hang in there Adora."
Glimmer says: "Next stop, Mystacor."
Bow says: "We rode a flying mountain through clouds."
Bow says: "It never gets old."
Adora says: "Uh, sure, yea, heh."
Adora says: "It was great."
Glimmer says: "Just so you know, my aunt Casta can be a lot."
Glimmer says: "But don't worry, I know how to handle her."
Castaspella says: "Is that my Glimmer?"
Glimmer says: "Hi, Aunt Casta."
Castaspella says: "It's been so long since you've come to visit."
Castaspella says: "And Bow."
Castaspella says: "And who's this?"
Glimmer says: "This is my friend Adora."
Glimmer says: "She's sometimes and 8 foot tall warrior woman named She-Ra."
Glimmer says: "So, don't get freaked out when it happens."
Adora says: "Hi."
Castaspella says: "Adora."
Castaspella says: "How nice Glimmer has started making some new friends."
Castaspella says: "We were all so pleased when she started bringing Bow around."
Castaspella says: "I was sure she had made him up at first."
Castaspella says: "Oh, you've done something to your hair."
Glimmer says: "What?"
Glimmer says: "Yes, I cut it."
Castaspella says: "I can see that."
Castaspella says: "I also see you're not wearing the sweater I knitted for you."
Castaspella says: "Don't you like it?"
Glimmer says: "Sure, I like it."
Glimmer says: "It's great."
Glimmer says: "It's just..."
Glimmer says: "it's a little warm for sweaters right now."
Castaspella says: "But you'd tell me if you didn't like it?"
Glimmer says: "Yes, I'd tell you."
Bow says: "I'm wearing the socks you sent me."
Castaspella says: "Well, I've always been fond of this one."
Castaspella says: "So, what brings you all the way out here to visit your aunt?"
Castaspella says: "Is it once in a blue moon already?"
Glimmer says: "We're on a diplomatic mission, Auntie."
Glimmer says: "I'm rebuilding the Princess Alliance and..."
Castaspella says: "My goodness, you must be starving."
Castaspella says: "I'll have a feast prepared."
Castaspella says: "I'm sure your mother hasn't been feeding you."
Adora says: "Wow."
Castaspella says: "You've come at the perfect time, there's an eclipse this evening."
Castaspella says: "I'm headed right now to inspect the lunarium for the ceremony."
Castaspella says: "And nothing would make me happier than to give my favorite niece and her friends a tour."
Glimmer says: "Uh, Bow and I have had the tour before."
Glimmer says: "And we don't want to get in your way."
Bow says: "It's all right Glimmer."
Bow says: "Adora hasn't seen it."
Bow says: "It'll be fun."
Castaspella says: "Oh, well, I guess it's up to Adora then."
Castaspella says: "What do you say my dear?"
Adora says: "Uh..."
Adora says: "sure?"
Castaspella says: "Oh, I like her."
Adora says: "Wow."
Castaspella says: "The lunar lenses."
Castaspella says: "We use them in the monthly ceremonies to renew Mystacor's magic defenses and keep us shielded from the outside world."
Castaspella says: "You will be coming to the Eclipse Ceremony tonight, won't you?"
Glimmer says: "Aunt Casta, I've seen the ceremony dozens of times."
Glimmer says: "And we're all really tired from travelling."
Glimmer says: "Maybe we'll skip it this time?"
Castaspella says: "Nonsense."
Castaspella says: "You're friend Adora hasn't seen it, and it's quite a sight to behold for a newcomer."
Castaspella says: "Besides, don't you want to spend more time with your aunt?"
Glimmer says: "Of course."
Glimmer says: "But we also really wanted to show Adora the beach."
Castaspella says: "Well, if the beach is the only reason you're here, I really shouldn't keep you, should I?"
Castaspella says: "I certainly don't want to waste your time."
Glimmer says: "Auntie, I didn't mean it that way."
Adora gasps.
Shadow Spy hisses.
Bow says: "Adora?"
Castaspella says: "Well, someone is enthusiastic."
Castaspella says: "Ah, yes."
Castaspella says: "The hall of sorcerers."
Castaspella says: "These are the Great Ones that led Mystacor through the ages."
Castaspella says: "This is my Micah, my brother."
Castaspella says: "We trained in these very walls together."
Castaspella says: "Glimmer looks just like him you know."
Glimmer says: "He had a beard."
Adora says: "Wait, Glimmer's dad was your brother?"
Bow says: "Adora, do you know what aunt means?"
Adora says: "No."
Adora says: "I was just hoping somebody would eventually explain."
Glimmer says: "Auntie, we're going to avenge my dad and make sure the Horde never hurts anyone else."
Glimmer says: "Mom believes in us, and in She-Ra."
Castaspella says: "Well, if your mother believes, who am I not to?"
Castaspella says: "She's an angelic being after all, and I'm just a common sorceress."
Glimmer says: "Ugh."
Glimmer says: "Please, not this again."
Castaspella says: "She never writes to me you know."
Castaspella says: "I send letters, but do I ever get a reply?"
Adora says: "What happened to her?"
Castaspella says: "Light Spinner."
Castaspella says: "A scar on Mystacor's past."
Castaspella says: "She sought power and control above all else, and she was cast out."
Castaspella says: "Although, some say she never really left."
Castaspella says: "That she's only biding her time, waiting to exact her revenge."
Castaspella says: "But those are only children's tales, of course."
Castaspella says: "Anyway, on with the tour."
Castaspella says: "Are you hungry?"
Castaspella says: "I've had the dinning room redone since the last time you were here, Glimmer."
Shadow Spy hisses.
Adora gasps.
Glimmer says: "Okay."
Glimmer says: "Aunt Casta's gone to fix us a big dinner and now it's finally beach time!"
Bow says: "You okay?"
Glimmer says: "It's worse than we thought."
Glimmer says: "You need warm sand and calming waves, stat."
Shadow Spy hisses.
Shadow Weaver says: "It's time for something more."
Shadow Spy hisses.
Shadow Spy hisses.
Adora says: "So, we just, like, lie here?"
Glimmer says: "Absolutely."
Glimmer says: "Letting your cares melt away."
Glimmer says: "Didn't you do something like this to relax in the Horde?"
Adora says: "Uh, no."
Adora says: "We hit things."
Glimmer says: "Well, this is so much better."
Glimmer says: "Right Bow?"
Bow snoring.
Glimmer says: "Just try it, okay?"
Adora says: "Okay."
Adora mimics shooting noises.
Adora says: "Boop."
Adora says: "Okay."
Adora mimics bird noises.
Glimmer says: "This isn't working for you, is it?"
Adora says: "No."
Adora says: "Can I move now?"
Glimmer says: "Yes."
Glimmer says: "Clearly we're going to have to take this relaxation thing to the next level."
Glimmer says: "Bow, wake up."
Bow says: "What?"
Glimmer says: "Come on."
Glimmer says: "We need to show Adora the steam grotto."
Bow says: "Whoo!"
Bow says: "Steam grotto."
Adora says: "Wow."
Bow says: "Right?"
Bow says: "Ah."
Bow says: "Ooh."
Bow says: "Ah."
Glimmer says: "These pools are full of magical healing minerals."
Glimmer says: "The sorcerers use them to cleanse themselves of worry and fear before big ceremonies or spells."
Glimmer says: "Now, just clear your mind."
Glimmer says: "Breathe deeply."
Glimmer says: "Focus on the warmth on your skin."
Glimmer says: "Let your body go perfectly..."
Adora says: "Ah."
Shadow Weaver's disembodied voice says: "Adora."
Adora shouting.
Glimmer shouting.
Adora says: "No, no, no, no, no!"
Adora says: "Help!"
Glimmer says: "Adora!"
Adora says: "Shadow Weaver's here."
Adora says: "I saw her!"
Bow says: "Adora, there's no one else here."
Bow says: "You brought your sword in here?"
Bow says: "Are you ok?"
Bow says: "What happened?"
Adora says: "Shadow Weaver was here."
Adora says: "In the grotto."
Adora says: "And she was in in the sorcerers hall too."
Adora says: "I saw her shadow on the floor."
Glimmer says: "What are you talking about?"
Glimmer says: "Who is Shadow Weaver?"
Adora says: "Shadow Weaver raised me in the Horde."
Adora says: "She taught me how to read and tie my boots and how to subvert the enemy and be victorious in battle."
Glimmer says: "OK."
Glimmer says: "Sure, mom stuff."
Adora says: "No, commanding officer stuff..."
Adora says: "and mom stuff."
Glimmer says: "Adora, she isn't here."
Glimmer says: "She was never here."
Glimmer says: "It's not possible."
Adora says: "But you don't know what she's capable of."
Bow says: "Sounds like this Shadow Weaver really did a number on you growing up."
Bow says: "But you're okay now."
Bow says: "You got away from her."
Bow says: "Do you wanna try something else?"
Bow says: "We could get massages, or find you something to hit, if that would work better."
Adora says: "No."
Adora says: "It's okay."
Adora says: "I'm okay."
Adora says: "I think I need to be alone."
Adora says: "Clear my head."
Glimmer says: "You sure?"
Adora says: "Yea."
Glimmer says: "Adora has finally lost it."
Glimmer says: "Did you see her in there?"
Glimmer says: "I think she's going nuts."
Adora says: "I'm not crazy."
Adora says: "I'm, I'm not crazy."
Adora says: "You're just a stupid statue."
Adora says: "Pull it together Adora, there's no way Shadow Weaver can be here."
Shadow Spy growls.
Adora says: "For the honor of Grayskull!"
Catra's voice says: "Hey, Adora."
She-Ra says: "Catra, where are you?"
She-Ra says: "How did you find me here?"
Catra's voice says: "Nope."
Catra's voice says: "Getting colder."
She-Ra says: "Whatever you're doing, I won't let you get away with it."
She-Ra says: "Did Shadow Weaver send you?"
Catra's voice says: "What do you think?"
Catra's voice says: "Shadow Weaver controls us both."
Catra's voice says: "She always has."
She-Ra says: "Catra, wait."
Catra's voice laughs.
She-Ra says: "Catra?"
Hordak's voice says: "The Horde had high hopes for you, Force Captain."
Hordak's voice says: "Disappointing."
Hordak's voice says: "Does the Rebellion truly think you can save them?"
Hordak's voice says: "Nothing can stop the Horde, least of all you."
She-Ra says: "Show yourself."
Hordak's voice says: "You will lead them all, every Etherian, to their complete and utter annihilation."
Hordak's voice says: "Nothing will be left of Bright Moon but smoking ruins."
Hordak's voice says: "Your new friends buried beneath."
She-Ra yells Sword of Protection blasts, lunar crystals shatter.
Castaspella says: "What have you done?"
She-Ra says: "Uh,sorry."
She-Ra says: "I didn't mean..."
She-Ra says: "I thought I just saw..."
Glimmer says: "Adora!"
Castaspella says: "Your friend has destroyed a thousand years worth of sacred writings."
Castaspella says: "She could have destroyed the lenses that protect Mystacor."
Bow says: "She didn't mean to."
Bow says: "Adora would never..."
Castaspella says: "This is the kind of person you hang around with?"
Glimmer says: "Auntie, wait."
Adora says: "Glimmer."
Glimmer says: "It's okay, I'll handle her."
Bow says: "The Horde isn't here, Adora."
Bow says: "You need to sleep."
Bow says: "Promise me you'll try."
Adora says: "Okay, I'll try."
Shadow Spy hisses.
Adora says: "Glimmer."
Glimmer says: "Save it, Adora."
Glimmer says: "How could you do this?"
Glimmer says: "I thought you were supposed to be our friend."
Adora says: "I am your friend."
Glimmer says: "You've ruined everything I've worked for."
Glimmer says: "What kind of a friend does that?"
Adora says: "Glimmer."
Glimmer says: "You know what?"
Glimmer says: "Maybe you should just go."
Glimmer says: "Is Adora coming?"
Bow says: "I didn't want to wake her up."
Bow says: "She needs to sleep."
Shadow Spy erupts.
Castaspella gasps.
Shadow Spy hisses.
Bow says: "Adora, come on, we have to get out of here now."
Adora says: "What's happening?"
Bow says: "The protection spell is failing."
Bow says: "We need to go!"
Adora says: "Wait, stop."
Adora says: "What do you mean failing?"
Adora says: "Where's Glimmer?"
Bow says: "Everything that's about to happen is your fault, Adora."
Bow says: "You're to blame."
Shadow Spy Bow hisses.
Bow, Glimmer, Castaspella, unnamed sorcerers groaning.
Shadow Weaver says: "Adora."
Adora says: "Shadow Weaver!"
Shadow Weaver says: "The eclipse is nearly over Adora."
Shadow Weaver says: "When it is, the shield will be down."
Shadow Weaver says: "The Horde will conquer Mystacor and bring you home to me."
Adora says: "No, I'll stop you."
Shadow Weaver says: "Why?"
Shadow Weaver says: "To help these people?"
Shadow Weaver says: "Who are they to you?"
Shadow Weaver says: "They don't understand you."
Shadow Weaver says: "Just as they did not understand me when I walked among them as Light Spinner."
Adora says: "What?"
Shadow Weaver says: "They feared my dark power."
Shadow Weaver says: "They'll never accept you."
Shadow Weaver says: "Not like I do."
Adora says: "No, no!"
Adora says: "You're wrong."
Adora says: "For the honor of Grayskull!"
Sword of Protection blinks weakly.
Shadow Weaver says: "You know deep down what I say is true."
Shadow Weaver says: "You are the ambitious, cutthroat, ruthless warrior I raised you to be."
Adora says: "No."
Shadow Weaver says: "The Princesses don't care about you."
Shadow Weaver says: "They want to use you for your strength."
Shadow Weaver says: "Return now to the Fright Zone."
Shadow Weaver says: "Rule by my side."
Adora says: "These are my friends."
Adora says: "They've been kind to me."
Adora says: "Something you never were."
Shadow Weaver says: "I prepared you for greatness!"
Adora says: "But you never loved me."
Adora says: "You just played twisted mind games."
Adora says: "I'm none of the things you say I am."
Adora says: "I'm not like you."
Adora says: "You are bitter and cruel, and you're the one who used me!"
Adora says: "This is who I am."
Adora says: "You hurt my friends, so now you're gonna pay!"
Shadow Weaver says: "It's too late."
Shadow Weaver says: "The eclipse will be over in moments."
Shadow Weaver says: "Mystacor will fall and it will be your fault."
Adora grunts.
Sword of Protections thrums, transforms into a shield and blasts Shadow Weaver with a beam of light.
Shadow Weaver yells.
Adora says: "Huh?"
Shadow Weaver says: "I can give you Etheria."
Shadow Weaver says: "We can rule together."
Shadow Weaver says: "You were nothing before I took you in, Adora."
Shadow Weaver says: "And you will be nothing without me!"
Shadow Weaver says: "You're weak!"
Adora grunts.
Shadow Weaver says: "Adora, enough of this."
Shadow Weaver says: "Come home."
Adora says: "I'm not going back."
Adora says: "You have no power over me anymore."
Shadow Weaver says: "No!"
Glimmer says: "Adora, are you okay?"
Adora says: "I'm okay."
Adora says: "Yeah, I think I'm finally okay."
Adora says: "She's gone."
Bow says: "I'm so sorry we didn't believe you!"
Bow says: "We've been bad friends."
Adora says: "No!"
Adora says: "You're not."
Adora says: "This is what Shadow Weaver does."
Adora says: "She manipulates people, she pushes them apart."
Adora says: "But it's never going to work on me again."
Adora says: "I'm sorry, it's my fault she was here."
Adora says: "I endangered Mystacor."
Castaspella says: "Nonsense, you saved Mystacor."
Castaspella says: "Glimmer has chosen her friends well."
Castaspella says: "I'll knit you a sweater."
Castaspella says: "What size are you in the shoulders?"
Adora says: "I'm like, really tired."
Adora says: "Glimmer?"
Glimmer says: "Right here, Adora."
Catra says: "Hello?"
Catra says: "Shadow Weaver?"
Catra says: "You've been going about this the wrong way, old woman."
Catra says: "If you wanna take down Adora, you have to go for the heart."
