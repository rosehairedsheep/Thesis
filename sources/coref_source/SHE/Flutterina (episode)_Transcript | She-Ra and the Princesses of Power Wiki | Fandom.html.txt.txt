Catra grunting.
Dream.
Catra says: "This time I am going to win."
Catra says: "I don't care what it takes."
Catra says: "We are opening that portal."
Catra says: "Now."
Entrapta says: "No."
Entrapta says: "I won't."
Entrapta says: "I need to tell Hordak."
Entrapta says: "He'll understand."
Catra says: "Get her out of here."
Entrapta says: "What did you do to me?"
Adora says: "Why did you do it?"
Catra says: "Stay away from me."
Theme Song Plays.
Hordak says: "Was this your doing, Entrapta?"
Imp says: "Entrapta?"
Imp says: "Entrapta?"
Imp says: "Entrapta?"
Catra* says: "Hmm."
Catra* says: "Ouch."
Catra* says: "What happened here?"
Hordak says: "The rebels managed to capture one of our bots and retrofit it with some sort of surge device."
Hordak says: "It decimated an entire squadron of our machines."
Catra* says: "Not to speak ill of the dearly departed, but exactly how many battles have your bots lost us lately?"
Hordak says: "You'd be wise to watch your tone."
Catra* says: "Aren't you tired of losing?"
Catra* says: "After all, clock's ticking."
Catra* says: "Big Brother Prime could show up at any moment."
Hordak says: "Even you, Catra, should fear being this bold in my presence."
Catra says: "Cool trick, huh?"
Catra says: "Lord Hordak, I'd like to introduce you to Double Trouble."
Catra says: "They're our newest asset in taking down the Rebellion."
Double Trouble says: "Apologies for being rude."
Double Trouble says: "I was getting into character."
Double Trouble says: "Did it work?"
Double Trouble says: "Be honest."
Double Trouble says: "I'm always open to constructive criticism."
Hordak says: "A shape-shifter."
Hordak says: "Impressive indeed."
Hordak says: "Do not attempt to deceive me again."
Catra says: "So, what's all this about?"
Hordak says: "The bots were a part of the occupation of Elberon."
Hordak says: "A failed operation."
Hordak says: "The rebels seized the town."
Hordak says: "It seems their technological capabilities have increased since--Since Entrapta returned to them."
Hordak says: "It is of no consequence."
Hordak says: "I will improve our machines and we will seize Elberon back."
Catra says: "Elberon?"
Catra says: "Why?"
Hordak says: "It may have escaped your notice, but we are trying to win a war."
Catra says: "See, you're thinking about this wrong."
Catra says: "Elberon doesn't matter."
Catra says: "It's what it can do for us that counts."
Hordak says: "And what do you propose?"
Bow says: "That's when Adora turned her sword into a giant spear, skewered a bot, and then used the bot to hit more bots."
Adora says: "And then Bow used his slick oil arrow to slip them up, and then right off a cliff."
Adora says: "Bam!"
Swift Wind says: "And I kicked them."
Glimmer says: "Yes!"
Glimmer says: "Get them."
Adora says: "But we were totally surrounded."
Adora says: "And then..."
Bow says: "My new surge device worked perfectly."
Bow says: "Took out the rest of the bots in one go."
Swift Wind says: "And I kicked them."
Glimmer says: "Amazing."
Glimmer says: "These bots didn't stand a chance against the Best Friend Squad."
Glimmer says: "I really wish I could've been there."
Glimmer says: "At least you'll be back soon, right?"
Bow says: "Uh..."
Bow says: "Soon."
Bow says: "Yeah."
Bow says: "There's just one more thing we have to take care of."
Adora says: "Just some really boring wrap-up stuff."
Swift Wind says: "The people love us because we saved Elberon, so they're throwing us a celebratory dinner."
Glimmer says: "Heh."
Glimmer says: "A dinner?"
Glimmer says: "That sounds fun."
Adora says: "Oh, it's really not a big deal."
Bow says: "Yeah, I bet they do this for everyone."
Glimmer says: "You guys, of course they wanna thank you."
Glimmer says: "You freed a whole town from Horde control."
Glimmer says: "I just..."
Adora says: "Well, if you need us, we can totally skip out on this dinner thing."
Glimmer says: "No way."
Glimmer says: "Go enjoy your victory."
Swift Wind says: "Great, because I am famished."
Swift Wind says: "Are we going now?"
Bow says: "You really aren't missing anything."
Bow says: "You know, we'll drop by to be polite and then head home."
Adora says: "Yep."
Adora says: "I'm sure it'll be super boring."
Glimmer says: "What is it?"
Glimmer says: "What's going on?"
Adora says: "Nothing."
Adora says: "Super boring."
Bow says: "Gotta go."
Bow says: "Wish you were here."
Swift Wind says: "Ooh."
Adora says: "It's a party."
Bow says: "It's a big party."
Adora says: "And it's for us."
Bow says: "It's a big party for us."
Adora says: "As individuals?"
Adora says: "Is that normal?"
Adora says: "Does this happen often?"
Elberon Mayor says: "Ah, there you are."
Elberon Mayor says: "Our heroes."
Elberon Mayor says: "Oh, we couldn't possibly thank you enough for liberating our town."
Adora says: "We sort of do this a lot."
Adora says: "You really, really didn't have to go through all this trouble."
Elberon Mayor says: "It was supposed to be a small dinner."
Elberon Mayor says: "You know, a quiet meal, but then word got out and suddenly everyone's invited."
Elberon Mayor says: "So here we are."
Elberon Mayor says: "Rowdy, calling attention to ourselves, basically sitting targets."
Elberon Mayor says: "What was that?"
Elberon Mayor says: "Okay, okay."
Elberon Mayor says: "Terrifying booming sounds were probably a bad idea."
Townsperson says: "She-Ra."
Townsperson says: "You saved us."
Adora says: "I mean, it's my job."
Adora says: "It's what I do."
Adora says: "It's..."
Adora says: "So it's not a big deal."
Adora says: "At all."
Townsperson says: "And Tech Master Bow of the Rebellion."
Townsperson says: "Oh, you have to show off your arrows to the kids."
Townsperson says: "They're obsessed with them."
Bow says: "Really?"
Bow says: "Hey."
Townsperson says: "We've heard stories of your victories, but to see you destroy those bots in person?"
Townsperson says: "Mm."
Townsperson says: "Amazing."
Flutterina says: "That's nothing compared to when She-Ra took on the monsters of the Northern Reach."
Flutterina says: "Or when she single-handedly won the Battle of Bright Moon."
Adora says: "Oh, I wouldn't say single-handedly."
Adora says: "I mean, I guess I--I guess I played kind of an important part."
Flutterina says: "Kind of important?"
Flutterina says: "Try huge."
Flutterina says: "You fought off the Horde, you united the Princesses, and you saved Etheria, and you are the coolest."
Adora says: "Uh, yeah, I mean, that was pretty cool, wasn't it?"
Flutterina says: "One day, I'm gonna leave Elberon and join the Rebellion, fighting side-by-side with you."
Flutterina says: "I'm Flutterina, by the way."
Flutterina says: "Oh!"
Flutterina says: "I'm shaking hands with She-Ra."
Adora says: "Can you believe this?"
Adora says: "All of this is for us."
Adora says: "People like us."
Adora says: "But we told Glimmer we wouldn't stay long."
Bow says: "I mean, but we have to stay."
Bow says: "It would be rude not to."
Bow says: "Right?"
Adora says: "Right."
Adora says: "We'll just stay for a minute and then-- Me cake!"
Adora says: "There's a me cake!"
Bow says: "This is the best party ever."
Adora says: "Yeah."
Adora says: "This is so fun."
Adora says: "They've got stories about me."
Adora says: "Not some long ago She-Ra of the past."
Adora says: "Me, and what I did."
Bow says: "I know, right?"
Bow says: "This is awesome."
Bow says: "We should rescue Elberon more often."
Elberon Mayor says: "It's the Horde."
Townsperson says: "We must get the people to safety."
Elberon Mayor says: "Our scouts have reported a bot."
Elberon Mayor says: "It's bigger than anything we've ever seen."
Elberon Mayor says: "It's on its way here."
Elberon Mayor says: "Oh, we need to evacuate the town."
Elberon Mayor says: "Now."
Adora says: "Everyone, stay calm."
Adora says: "You're under our protection."
Adora says: "Let She-Ra handle this."
All says: "She-Ra."
All says: "She-Ra."
All says: "She-Ra."
All says: "She-Ra!"
Townsperson says: "We love you."
Elberon Mayor says: "Are you sure we shouldn't prepare?"
Elberon Mayor says: "As I always say, cautious today, here tomorrow."
Adora says: "Don't worry."
Adora says: "After all, it's my job and I'm pretty good at it."
Adora says: "Enjoy the festivities."
Crowd says: "She-Ra."
Crowd says: "She-Ra."
Bow says: "Why do all of our parties have to end with the Horde attacking?"
Adora says: "Bow, it's okay."
Adora says: "Stay here and watch the townspeople."
Adora says: "There's no reason for the party to stop."
Bow says: "Are you sure?"
Adora says: "Swift Wind and I can deal with this."
Adora says: "You heard the mayor, it's one bot."
Adora says: "How tough can it be for She-Ra?"
Adora says: "Just stay and have fun."
Adora says: "We'll be right back."
Swift Wind says: "She-Ra and Swift Wind forever."
Swift Wind says: "Uhh..."
Swift Wind says: "That one's bigger than usual."
Adora says: "Nothing we can't handle."
Adora says: "Piece of cake, huh?"
Swift Wind says: "Does cake normally grow back and turn into more pieces of cake when you cut it?"
Adora says: "Looks like these things can multiply."
Adora says: "We need to be careful about how we destroy them."
Swift Wind says: "How do we carefully destroy something?"
Swift Wind says: "Is it magical sacred bond time?"
Adora says: "Can't say I'm too impressed with Hordak's new toys."
Swift Wind says: "Did it feel a little too easy to you?"
Adora says: "No, like they said in Elberon."
Adora says: "We're awesome."
Adora says: "Let's get back to the party."
Adora says: "Hey everyone."
Adora says: "Just wait until you hear about..."
Swift Wind says: "Where did everyone go?"
Swift Wind says: "Is this one of those parties Bow told us about where people hide and shout "surprise"?"
Adora says: "No, he said that happens before the party starts."
Adora says: "Something's wrong."
Swift Wind says: "What was that?"
Adora says: "There."
Flutterina says: "Huh?"
Flutterina says: "You're back."
Adora says: "What happened here?"
Flutterina says: "The Horde, it was awful."
Flutterina says: "They attacked as soon as you left."
Flutterina says: "Bow tried to fight, he's the only reason some people were able to escape."
Flutterina says: "But they took him and everyone else."
Adora says: "That bot in the woods."
Adora says: "It must have been a diversion so that I'd leave Elberon defenseless."
Adora says: "And I fell for it."
Adora says: "This is my fault."
Adora says: "We need to find them."
Flutterina says: "I know I'm small and I'm not a Rebellion fighter, but I wanna help."
Flutterina says: "So, can I come?"
Elberon Mayor says: "Are you okay?"
Bow says: "I'll be fine."
Bow says: "Where are we?"
Bow says: "Where are my arrows?"
Elberon Mayor says: "The soldiers took our weapons when they tossed us in here."
Townsperson says: "We're doomed."
Townsperson says: "What good is the Tech Master without his tech?"
Townsperson says: "Bow without his bow?"
Elberon Mayor says: "We should have evacuated the town instead of listening to She-Ra."
Bow says: "She-Ra and Swift Wind won't rest until they find us."
Bow says: "But that doesn't mean we can't work on getting out of here."
Bow says: "I'm still Bow the Tech Master, even without my arrows."
Bow says: "I can get us out of this."
Scorpia says: "Look at us."
Scorpia says: "You and me in the field, side-by-side."
Scorpia says: "Taking a bunch of random prisoners from a party, putting said prisoners in a big pit, guarding said pit."
Scorpia says: "Ugh, if that doesn't say friendship, I don't know what does."
Scorpia says: "The super pal duo is back."
Catra says: "What about the weapons we confiscated?"
Scorpia says: "Oh, yeah, you gotta see this."
Scorpia says: "Huh?"
Scorpia says: "Huh?"
Scorpia says: "I know it's just cut up pieces of paper, but gosh, isn't it so much fun?"
Catra says: "We need to focus."
Catra says: "She-Ra was in Elberon."
Catra says: "Which means she's nearby."
Scorpia says: "Do you think she'll try some secret attack?"
Catra says: "Oh, I'm counting on it."
Scorpia says: "Is that why you kidnapped everyone?"
Scorpia says: "Some plot against the Princess Alliance?"
Scorpia says: "I could help if I knew what you were up to."
Scorpia says: "You know, like old times."
Catra says: "It's a new strategy, okay?"
Catra says: "That's all you need to know."
Scorpia says: "Oh, yeah, sure, sure, gotcha."
Scorpia says: "Uh, feeling a little left out is all."
Scorpia says: "You know, ever since that whole portal thing."
Catra says: "Get over it then."
Adora says: "There's the guard post."
Adora says: "If we can get inside, we can figure out where Bow and the others are being held."
Swift Wind says: "How are we supposed to get in there without being seen?"
Swift Wind says: "I mean, you're She-Ra."
Swift Wind says: "You don't exactly blend in."
Swift Wind says: "It's a side effect of being majestic."
Flutterina says: "I think I have an idea."
Flutterina says: "Ahem."
Flutterina says: "Oh, no."
Flutterina says: "You've caught me."
Flutterina says: "How will I ever get away?"
Flutterina says: "Oh, no."
Adora says: "This must be where they're keeping them."
Flutterina says: "What do we do?"
Adora says: "We save them."
Adora says: "For the honor of Grayskull."
Flutterina says: "Awesome."
Adora says: "Wait, this doesn't make sense."
Adora says: "The map says the pit would be here."
Adora says: "We'll handle this."
Adora says: "Stay out of sight."
Flutterina says: "Okay."
Swift Wind says: "Oh, yeah, they regenerate."
Adora says: "We forgot the bots regenerate."
Bow says: "Ah."
Bow says: "This isn't my first time in a Horde cell."
Bow says: "Luckily, they didn't search you well enough."
Bow says: "Can I borrow this?"
Bow says: "Yes."
Catra says: "Hey, Adora."
Catra says: "Took you long enough to show up."
Adora says: "Catra."
Catra says: "Seriously."
Catra says: "I thought I'd have to kidnap another town to get your attention."
Catra says: "Oh, that's right, you were having a party."
Catra says: "Must've thought you were pretty special."
Adora says: "Can we skip the speech?"
Adora says: "I'm done playing your games, Catra."
Adora says: "Too many people got hurt when you set off that portal."
Adora says: "I hope it was worth it."
Adora says: "Because I won't let you hurt my friends or anyone else ever again."
Catra says: "You were the one who left the villagers unprotected."
Catra says: "You're good enough at hurting your friends without my help."
Catra says: "But you're still terrible at spotting traps."
Catra says: "Pretty good, huh?"
Catra says: "I got the idea from Shadow Weaver."
Catra says: "At least she was good for something in the end."
Catra says: "If only your friends could see you now."
Bow says: "No guards?"
Bow says: "Weird."
Bow says: "All right, that's everyone."
Bow says: "Now let's get out of here."
Flutterina says: "Bow."
Bow says: "Flutterina?"
Bow says: "What are you doing here?"
Flutterina says: "It's She-Ra."
Flutterina says: "She's in trouble and she needs help."
Catra says: "You know, Adora, your whole self-righteous hero thing is getting old."
Catra says: "At least I finally found a way to shut you up."
Catra says: "Ow!"
Flutterina says: "Hey."
Flutterina says: "Get away from She-Ra."
Bow says: "Adora."
Catra says: "Aw."
Catra says: "Looks like your friends came to watch."
Catra says: "Why don't we put on a show for them?"
Bow says: "We have to do something."
Flutterina says: "Wait."
Flutterina says: "Look."
Adora says: "Swift Wind."
All says: "Three cheers for She-Ra!"
Adora says: "Thank you."
Adora says: "We couldn't have gotten out without you guys."
Bow says: "Thank Flutterina."
Bow says: "It was her quick thinking that saved us."
Flutterina says: "I know you think I'm just a kid, but I'm ready to join the Rebellion."
Flutterina says: "I wanna fight the Horde and keep my people safe, like She-Ra."
Adora says: "The Rebellion could use someone brave and clever like you."
Adora says: "We'd be honored."
Flutterina says: "Thank you."
Flutterina says: "Thank you so much."
Scorpia says: "Catra, there you are."
Scorpia says: "Are you okay?"
Scorpia says: "Don't worry about that Adora stuff."
Scorpia says: "I'm here and there's nothing we can't fix, because that's what friends are for."
Scorpia says: "I'm sure Hordak will understand."
Scorpia says: "Oh."
Catra says: "Stop it."
Catra says: "Stop badgering me."
Catra says: "Stop hovering over me."
Catra says: "Just back off."
Catra says: "I don't need to explain myself to you."
Catra says: "We're not friends."
Catra says: "Oh, and Scorpia?"
Catra says: "Keep Emily out of my sight or I'll sell her for scrap."
Catra says: "Understand?"
Swift Wind says: "Sacred bond, saving the day."
Flutterina says: "I'm joining the Rebellion."
Flutterina says: "Can you believe it?"
Flutterina says: "Me, Flutterina."
Flutterina says: "This is the most exciting day of my life."
Bow says: "You okay?"
Adora says: "Ugh."
Adora says: "I put everyone in danger because I thought I could handle everything by myself."
Adora says: "I was so excited that everyone was treating me like a hero, I forgot to act like one."
Bow says: "Hey."
Bow says: "Elberon's safe and we got a new recruit for the Rebellion."
Adora says: "You're right."
Adora says: "I couldn't have done it without you."
Adora says: "Thanks, Bow."
Bow says: "Anytime."
Bow says: "Now let's go home."
Hordak says: "Did it work?"
Catra says: "Like a charm."
Catra says: "The plan is under way."
Adora says: "Welcome to Bright Moon."
Catra says: "Those idiots won't know what hit them."
