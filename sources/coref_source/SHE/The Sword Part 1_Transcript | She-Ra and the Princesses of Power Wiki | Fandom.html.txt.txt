Unknown Blue Horde Member says: "Here's your scenario."
Unknown Blue Horde Member says: "You'll be passing through the treacherous Whispering Woods to reach the heart of the rebel insurgency, Bright Moon."
Unknown Blue Horde Member says: "Your mission is to defeat the Queen of the Princesses and liberate Bright Moon in Lord Hordak's name."
Unknown Blue Horde Member says: "Where's Catra?"
Adora says: "She will be here."
Adora says: "I promise."
Unknown Blue Horde Member says: "Mm-hmm."
Unknown Blue Horde Member says: "The Whispering Woods is full of princesses."

Kyle says: "Oh, no, no, no, no, no!"
Shouting.
The princess fires as the recruits dash into the arena. Adora hurls an explosive.
Adora says: "Come on, this way."
The recruits run and Catra watches from above.
Kyle is hit. His teammates return to him. His suit is sizzling and an X appears on the plate.
Kyle says: "Aw, dang it."

Catra says: "How's it hanging?"
Adora says: "Catra."
Adora says: "Did you really show up late and let us do all the hard parts?"
Adora says: "That is low, even for you."
Catra says: "Aw."
Catra says: "You know nothing's too low for me."

Shadow Weaver says: "You have done well."
Shadow Weaver says: "You've completed your training course in record time."
Adora says: "Uh, well, that wasn't just me."
Adora says: "You know, Catra did, too."
Shadow Weaver says: "Ah, yes."
Shadow Weaver says: "How someone as unmotivated as you completed the course in that time, I'll never know."
Catra says: "Always serving up those pep talks, huh, Shadow Weaver?"
Shadow Weaver says: "Silence."

Adora says: "Really?"
Adora says: "Force Captain?"
Adora says: "Lord Hordak said that about me?"
Shadow Weaver says: "Oh yes."
Shadow Weaver says: "He sees great promise in you."
Shadow Weaver says: "In fact, he has elected you the honor of leading a squadron in the invasion of the rebel Fortress of Thaymor."
Adora says: "Thaymor?"
Adora says: "You mean we're finally seeing active duty?"
Shadow Weaver says: "You are seeing active duty."
Adora says: "But I'll be able to bring my team along, right?"
Shadow Weaver says: "Your team is not ready."
Shadow Weaver says: "They'll only slow you down."
Adora says: "Shadow Weaver, with respect, they've been training hard for this, too."
Adora says: "And Catra, all she wants is to get out there and prove herself."
Shadow Weaver says: "Then she should have worked harder to prove herself to me."
Shadow Weaver says: "This is what I raised you for, Adora."
Shadow Weaver says: "Now is your chance to prove yourself."
Shadow Weaver says: "I saw talent in you the moment I found you as an orphan child and took you in."
Shadow Weaver says: "Is this not what you've wanted since you were old enough to want anything?"
Adora says: "Yes."
Shadow Weaver says: "With you at the forefront, we will crush the Bright Moon Rebellion once and for all."
Shadow Weaver says: "Do not disappoint me."

Angella says: "Send her in."
Glimmer says: "Your Majesty."
Angella says: "I'm told you disobeyed orders and led the Rebellion into a dangerous combat situation after you were ordered to retreat."
Glimmer says: "I was trying to protect a village from falling into The Horde's grasp."
Angella says: "You were reckless and put yourself and the other rebels in danger."
Glimmer says: "Fighting is supposed to be dangerous!"
Glimmer says: "How are we going to hold our own against The Horde if we keep retreating?"
Glimmer says: "Pretty soon, we won't have anything left to defend."
Angella says: "I'm growing tired of your back-talking, Commander Glimmer."
Glimmer says: "Why did you even make me a commander if you won't let me fight?"
Angella says: "That's enough!"
Angella says: "You're grounded!"
Glimmer says: "Mom!"
Angella says: "You heard me!"
Glimmer says: "You never let me do anything!"

Catra says: "We're gonna see the world and conquer it."
Catra says: "Adora, I need to blow something up."
Adora says: "Umm.."
Catra says: "What?"
Adora says: "Shadow Weaver says you're not coming."
Catra says: "What?"
Catra says: "My time was just as good as yours today."
Catra says: "What is her problem with me?"
Adora says: "I mean, you are kind of disrespectful."
Catra says: "Why should I respect her?"
Catra says: "She's just bitter that she doesn't have any real power that doesn't come from Hordak and everyone knows it."
Catra says: "I guess it sure must be easy being a people pleaser like you."
Adora says: "I am not a pe-- Catra, wait."

Catra says: "Ugh, whatever."
Catra says: "It's not like I even care."
Catra says: "I just wanna get out of this dump at some point before I die of boredom."

Catra says: "I've always wanted to drive one of these things."
Catra says: "Here, gimme."
Adora says: "Whoa, there."
Adora says: "Save us enough fuel to get back."
Catra says: "That's a problem for future Adora and Catra."
Catra says: "I'm driving."
Adora says: "I'm driving."
Catra says: "I want it."
Adora says: "I want it."

Adora says: "Catra?"
Adora says: "What happened?"
Catra says: "You fell out of the skiff after you drove it into a tree."
Adora says: "No, you drove it into a tree."
Catra says: "Ah, up for debate."
Catra says: "Come on, let's go."
Adora says: "Wait."
Adora says: "Where is it?"
Adora says: "Where'd it go?"
Catra says: "What?"
Adora says: "Ther- There was a sword."
Adora says: "It was right here."
Adora says: "I tried to touch it, but it got really bright."
Catra says: "Are you brain damaged?"

Glimmer says: "I feel like you..."
Glimmer says: "don't respect me."
Glimmer says: "Watch it!"
Glimmer says: "You almost hit me!"
Bow says: "Hey, Glimmer."
Glimmer says: "Shh!"
Glimmer says: "Bow, what are you doing here?"
Bow says: "What did you say?"
Bow says: "Come down here."
Glimmer says: "I can't, I'm grounded."
Bow says: "What?"
Glimmer says: "I'm grounded."
Bow says: "..."
Bow says: "What?"
Glimmer says: "I'm..."
Glimmer says: "grounded."
Glimmer says: "I'm so mad at my mom."
Bow says: "Is this about the siege on Elberon?"
Glimmer says: "I was just trying to defend another one our villages from falling into The Horde's Clutches."
Glimmer says: "She stationed me all the way out here because it's too remote to ever get attacked, but then it did, and it was my one chance to prove that I can do this."
Glimmer says: "But she acts like I can't do anything because I'm just a princess."
Bow says: "That doesn't make any sense."
Bow says: "Everyone here is a princess."
Bow says: "I'm, like, the only one who's not a princess."
Glimmer says: "Tell that to my mom."
Bow says: "Hey, where does this go?"
Glimmer says: "Bottom drawer."
Bow says: "Anyway, your mom might have a point."
Bow says: "Only reason you got out of there is because of your teleportation powers, and, let's face it, they don't always work that well."
Glimmer says: "Looking for support here, Bow!"
Bow says: "I'm just saying, if you wanna prove yourself, it's gonna take more than running recklessly into any old battle."
Bow says: "Luckily, I've got just the thing."
Bow says: "Check this out."
Bow says: "I detected a piece of First Ones tech in the Whispering Woods."
Bow says: "A pretty powerful one, too, by the size of these readings."
Bow says: "If you find this one and bring it back, your mom is bound to be impressed."
Glimmer says: "Did you forget I'm grounded?"
Knocking on door.
Angella says: "Glimmer?"
Angella says: "Are you in there?"
Glimmer says: "Uh..."
Bow says: "Ah!"
Angella says: "Glimmer?"
Glimmer says: "Everything's fine, Mom."
Angella says: "Is someone else in there?"
Angella says: "I heard voices."
Glimmer says: "No one else is in here."
Glimmer says: "Can you please just leave me alone?"
Angella says: "I don't appreciate your tone right now, young lady."
Glimmer says: "What tone?"
Angella says: "That attitude of yours is never gonna help you know."
Angella says: "You cannot act that way!"
Glimmer says: "-And that's not fair!"
Door slams.

Robot Beeping.
Catra says: "What is wrong with you?"
Catra says: "You've been acting weird since we got back."
Catra says: "Are you sure you're not brain damaged?"
Adora says: "Look Catra, I know I saw something out there."
Adora says: "It's ju- I just need to get another look."
Adora says: "It feels important somehow."
Catra says: "Sounds good."
Catra says: "Let's go."
Adora says: "No."

Bow says: "Come on!"
Glimmer says: "Uh!"
Glimmer says: "Please tell me we're not lost!"
Bow says: "No, this thing is just acting up."
Bow says: "Looks like it's being overloaded by the tech's signal."
Bow says: "We must be getting close!"
Glimmer says: "Uhh..."
Glimmer says: "I think it's that way."
Bow says: "What makes you say that?"
Bow says: "Oh, yeah."
Bow says: "That'll do it."
Adora says: "What are you doing out here, Adora?"
Adora says: "Catra's right, this is crazy."
Adora says: "There's no sword, you just got hit on the head a little too hard."
Adora says: "You should just go back home and forget about all of this."
Glimmer says: "Bow, just let me lead the way, okay?"
Bow says: "The light came from the edge of the forest."
Glimmer says: "Yes, you saw the light."
Glimmer says: "It's this way."
Bow says: "The trackpad says otherwise."
Glimmer says: "Horde soldier!"
Bow says: "I see her!"
Glimmer says: "Bow, catch."
Adora says: "Give me the sword."
Yelling.
Adora says: "Get off."
Adora says: "Stand down."
Adora says: "I don't wanna hurt you."
Glimmer says: "Since when do Horde soldiers not want to hurt anyone?"
All Grunting and shouting.
Adora says: "What?"
Female voice says: "Hello, Adora."
Adora says: "Who are you?"
Adora says: "What's going on?"
Female voice says: "My name is Light Hope."
Female voice says: "I have been waiting a long time for you, but I could not reach you until you forged your connection with the sword."
Adora says: "You sent the sword?"
Light Hope says: "The sword is meant for you."
Light Hope says: "Etheria has need of you, Adora."
Light Hope says: "Will you answer its call?"
Light Hope says: "Will you fight for the honor of Grayskull?"
Adora says: "What are you talking about?"
Adora says: "What-- What is-- What's Grayskull?"
Adora says: "You're not making any sense!"
Adora says: "I don't understand!"
Light Hope says: "You will."
Adora says: "Wait!"
Grunts.
Bow says: "Hey!"
Bow says: "She's awake."
Adora says: "What happened?"
Glimmer says: "Quiet, Horde spy, I ask the questions."
Glimmer says: "How did you make it this far into the Whispering Woods?"
Adora says: "I just walked in."
Adora says: "And I'm not a spy."
Glimmer says: "Sure, sure."
Glimmer says: "You just so happened to find yourself in the Whispering Woods, like you just so happened to try and steal our sword."
Adora says: "It's not yours."
Adora says: "I found it first."
Glimmer says: "The Whispering Woods is under the Rebellion's protection."
Glimmer says: "You were lucky to make it as far as you did."
Glimmer says: "Come on, Bow."
Glimmer says: "Let's get this spy back to Bright Moon where she can be interrogated properly."
Glimmer says: "This is perfect."
Glimmer says: "Not only do we First Ones tech for the rebellion, we've also captured a Horde spy."
Glimmer says: "My mom's gonna be so impressed."
Glimmer says: "Now come on, on your feet."
Scene change.
Bow says: "You positive we're going the right way, Glimmer?"
Glimmer says: "I know what I'm doing, Bow."
Glimmer says: "Can you please just trust me for once?"
Bow says: "You know I always trust you, but I'm starting to get a little freaked out."
Bow says: "I mean, I pretty much grew up in these woods and I've never even seen this part of them."
Bow says: "I've heard stories about weird stuff out here."
Glimmer says: "It's fine, okay?"
Glimmer says: "Just let me figure this out."
Bow says: "Okay!"
Bow says: "Touchy."
Bow says: "Sorry about her."
Bow says: "Usually she's really nice."
Bow says: "Not much for talking, huh?"
Adora says: "I prefer not to swap pleasantries with my captors."
Bow says: "Fair."
Bow says: "Suit yourself."
Adora says: "You know she's a princess, right?"
Adora says: "How can you follow her?"
Adora says: "Princesses are a dangerous threat to everyone on Etheria."
Bow says: "Is that what Hordak told you?"
Adora says: "Well I thought it was just common knowledge."
Adora says: "They're violent instigators who don't even know how to control their powers."
Bow says: "You've never actually met a princess, have you?"
Adora says: "Well, maybe not in person, but..."
Adora says: "What happened to this place?"
Glimmer says: "Don't play dumb with me."
Glimmer says: "I bet you were part of the raiding party that did this."
Adora says: "What are you talking about?"
Adora says: "The Horde didn't do this."
Glimmer says: "Oh yeah?"
Glimmer says: "You're a heartless destroyer, just like all the rest of your people."
Adora says: "I'm not a destroyer."
Adora says: "Hordak says we're doing what's best for Etheria."
Adora says: "We're trying to make things better."
Adora says: "More orderly."
Glimmer says: "This is what's best for Etheria?"
Glimmer says: "Ever since The Horde got here, they've been poisoning our land, burning our cities, destroying everything in their path."
Glimmer says: "And you're a part of it!"
Glimmer says: "How's that for orderly?"
Adora says: "This doesn't make any sense."
Adora says: "The Horde would never do something like this."
Bow says: "Did you really not know any of this?"
Bow says: "I mean, your army is called the Evil Horde."
Adora says: "Who calls us that?"
Bow says: "..."
Bow says: "Everybody!"
Adora says: "The Horde rescued me when I was a baby and gave me a home."
Adora says: "They're my family."
Adora says: "You-- you don't know them like I do."
Bow says: "Maybe you don't know them like you think you do."
Glimmer says: "There's something out there."
Glimmer says: "Something big."
Bow says: "How big?"
Ground Rumbling Grunts.
Bow says: "So, pretty big then."
Screeching.
Bow says: "Watch out!"
Grunting and Shouting.
Screech.
Adora says: "Hey, bug brain!"
Adora says: "Come on, Magic Sword."
Adora says: "Oh, where's a blinding flash of light when you need one?"

Light Hope says: "Adora."
Light Hope says: "Adora."
Baby Crying.
Light Hope says: "Will you fight for the honor of Grayskull?"
Adora says: "For the honor of Grayskull!"
