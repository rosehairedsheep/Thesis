Adora says: "Now."
Netossa says: "Boom, nets."
Adora says: "Everyone, be ready."
Adora says: "Our scouts reported the Horde is transporting a new prototype weapon."
Adora says: "And they wouldn't brave the Whispering Woods unless it was something powerful."
Bow says: "If I know Entrapta, this thing is gonna be big, unpredictable and..."
Bow says: "invisible."
Bow says: "Genius."
Bow says: "Or it's just empty."
Adora says: "But our scouts said Catra would be moving the weapon today."
Adora says: "It's supposed to be here."
Netossa says: "It's an ambush."
Opening Theme.
Glimmer says: "I don't understand how this happened."
Juliet says: "The Horde must have figured out we were going after the transport and laid a trap."
Netossa says: "Ooh."
Glimmer says: "Are you all okay?"
Bow says: "Never been better."
Bow says: "Okay, we've been slightly better."
Glimmer says: "How do they keep doing this?"
Glimmer says: "No matter where I send you, the Horde always shows up to ruin the mission."
Adora says: "It's okay, Glimmer."
Adora says: "Everyone knows you're needed in Bright Moon."
Bow says: "So, what's the plan?"
Swift Wind says: "Did someone say Swift Wind?"
Swift Wind says: "Swift-- Hang on."
Swift Wind says: "Did someone say--?"
Glimmer says: "No one said Swift Wind."
Swift Wind says: "But you just did."
Swift Wind says: "Anyway, I backtracked down the path the transport was on."
Swift Wind says: "It came from the mountains, on the far side of Bright Moon."
Bow says: "That could be where they're keeping the weapon."
Bow says: "We have to investigate."
Juliet says: "A smaller team will avoid detection."
Juliet says: "Get in and out before the Horde even knows you're there."
Glimmer says: "I hate sending you guys back out."
Adora says: "Hey."
Adora says: "Whatever this is, we need to destroy it before it's used on innocent people."
Adora says: "Right, guys?"
Netossa says: "Count us in."
Spinnerella says: "Darling, your arm."
Netossa says: "Uh-huh?"
Netossa says: "Nice try."
Netossa says: "Spinnerella refuses to accept that I busted two more bots than she did, so I'm winning."
Adora says: "So, uh, hey, how about we take this conversation to the War Room?"
Adora says: "We've got a mission to plan."
Swift Wind says: "Great."
Swift Wind says: "Let's go."
Flutterina says: "Oh, sorry, Your Majesty."
Glimmer says: "Sorry, Flutterina, I didn't see you."
Flutterina says: "Oh, it's okay."
Flutterina says: "Are you guys going on a mission?"
Flutterina says: "Can I come?"
Glimmer says: "Not this time."
Glimmer says: "And not all of us are going."
Flutterina says: "Next time, then."
Flutterina says: "Rebellion Soldier Flutterina is ready."
Flutterina says: "Have fun."
Catra says: "I can't get over how ridiculous you look, "Flutterina."
Flutterina says: "Right?"
Flutterina says: "I said to myself, "Double Trouble, what sort of character would the Princesses trust?"
Flutterina says: "" Someone tooth-achingly cute and pink."
Double Trouble says: "Then it came to me, Flutterina."
Catra says: "Yeah, great, whatever."
Catra says: "Is there any news?"
Double Trouble says: "Your team did quite a number on the Rebels."
Double Trouble says: "They came limping back in, so despondent, such emotion."
Double Trouble says: "Oh!"
Double Trouble says: "It was breathtaking."
Catra says: "Your intel was good, but they still got away."
Double Trouble says: "Espionage is a long game, kitten."
Double Trouble says: "The Rebels are tired, demoralized."
Double Trouble says: "And you should've seen Glimmer's face when she realized she'd been outsmarted again."
Glimmer* says: "How is the Horde always two steps ahead?"
Glimmer* says: "Angry sparkle, growl."
Catra says: "And any intel on She-Ra?"
Catra says: "Or are we done here?"
Double Trouble says: "So serious."
Double Trouble says: "Remember, this is supposed to be fun."
Catra says: "This is supposed to be war."
Double Trouble says: "No reason it can't be both."
Double Trouble says: "All business, no fun."
Double Trouble says: "She-Ra's putting together a team to track down Hordak's new weapon."
Catra says: "She-Ra's not going to find anything."
Catra says: "But they'll all see the weapon when the time comes."
Double Trouble says: "Ooh."
Double Trouble says: "Foreshadowing."
Double Trouble says: "Love this."
Shadow Weaver says: "Impressive."
Glimmer says: "Huh?"
Glimmer says: "What are you doing here?"
Shadow Weaver says: "I've come to tend my garden."
Glimmer says: "You've got to be kidding me."
Glimmer says: "You're gardening?"
Glimmer says: "You?"
Shadow Weaver says: "One must keep oneself occupied."
Shadow Weaver says: "Your power is truly a sight to behold."
Shadow Weaver says: "It's no wonder, you being Micah's daughter."
Shadow Weaver says: "I'd never seen a sorcerer like him."
Glimmer says: "I get it."
Glimmer says: "I'm the daughter of an angelic being and a powerful sorcerer, and I'll never be as good as either of them."
Shadow Weaver says: "That's true."
Shadow Weaver says: "You'll be better."
Shadow Weaver says: "Don't you remember your raw magical energy when we invaded the Fright Zone together?"
Glimmer says: "I remember you draining me."
Shadow Weaver says: "Yes."
Shadow Weaver says: "But I did help you become more powerful."
Glimmer says: "Well, luckily, I don't need your help for that anymore."
Shadow Weaver says: "No, I suppose not."
Shadow Weaver says: "Of course, it's all wasted if you don't use it."
Shadow Weaver says: "I've been watching you."
Shadow Weaver says: "You're trying to be like your mother, overseeing things from afar."
Shadow Weaver says: "But you are not her."
Shadow Weaver says: "You must decide for yourself what kind of queen you will be."
Glimmer says: "And I've decided."
Glimmer says: "I'm a queen who doesn't take advice from prisoners."
Adora says: "Stay close, and stay quiet."
Bow says: "Guys, do you hear something?"
Spinnerella says: "It's an ambush."
Spinnerella says: "Again."
Netossa says: "This one's mine."
Netossa says: "Ha!"
Netossa says: "Two for one."
Netossa says: "Still winning."
Adora says: "Is..."
Adora says: "Is that the new weapon?"
Swift Wind says: "It's not very big."
Swift Wind says: "Or move-y."
Bow says: "It could be a surveillance bot."
Adora says: "Bow?"
Adora says: "Bow!"
Bow says: "Did we win?"
Glimmer says: "Bow."
Glimmer says: "Thank goodness."
Glimmer says: "I was so scared."
Bow says: "I feel like we didn't win."
Glimmer says: "Bow, are you okay?"
Bow says: "Don't worry about me."
Bow says: "I'm fine."
Bow says: "I'm just, you know, gonna lie here for a bit."
Glimmer says: "Why is he not okay?"
Adora says: "Even with healing, he's still going to need some time to recover."
Glimmer says: "I can't keep sending my friends into ambushes."
Glimmer says: "How does the Horde know our every move?"
Juliet* says: "I'm sorry, Your Majesty."
Juliet* says: "I hate to suggest it, but could they be tracking She-Ra?"
Glimmer says: "That could explain how they always know where you are."
Adora says: "Bow..."
Adora says: "I'm sorry."
Adora says: "It's my fault you got hurt."
Glimmer says: "No."
Glimmer says: "This is Catra's fault."
Glimmer says: "Her, and her bots, and--and me."
Glimmer says: "I sent you out, knowing it was dangerous, while I stayed here, safe and sound."
Bow says: "Don't worry about me."
Bow says: "I'm the one who worries about you."
Bow says: "Can we go back to that?"
Bow says: "Please?"
Adora says: "I'm going back to find that bot and destroy it."
Glimmer says: "No."
Glimmer says: "If the Horde is tracking you, they're gonna be ready."
Glimmer says: "What if--?"
Adora says: "Glimmer, you said it yourself."
Adora says: "We can't risk more people getting hurt."
Adora says: "General?"
Glimmer says: "Don't worry, Bow."
Glimmer says: "I'm gonna take care of this."
Bow* says: "Catra."
Bow* says: "I knew you were behind this."
Catra says: "Ugh."
Bow* says: "Oh, no, the new weapon!"
Bow* says: "It's firing."
Glimmer* says: "If only I was there to sparkle at it."
Glimmer* says: "Oh, Bow!"
Bow* says: "Glimmer!"
Adora* says: "She-Ra!"
Catra says: "Show me She-Ra again."
Adora* says: "I'm She-Ra."
Double Trouble says: "Ah."
Double Trouble says: "There it is."
Catra says: "There what is?"
Double Trouble says: "The thrill of seeding destruction and chaos."
Catra says: "Ahem."
Catra says: "I'll be thrilled if the Pulsebot really blew that dummy up."
Double Trouble says: "Sadly, Bow's been healed by some glowy magic."
Double Trouble says: "Very dramatic stuff."
Double Trouble says: "Oh, cheer up."
Double Trouble says: "I'm sending coordinates for She-Ra's position."
Double Trouble says: "She's going back out to destroy the bot that hurt her friend."
Catra says: "Ugh."
Catra says: "Typical heroic Adora plan."
Catra says: "Too bad we'll be gone by the time she gets there."
Catra says: "But if it's to take down She-Ra, I think we could stand a delay."
Double Trouble says: "I knew there was a reason I liked you."
Double Trouble says: "Having fun yet?"
Catra says: "You know, I think I am."
Glimmer says: "Give us a minute."
Glimmer says: "That's an order."
Glimmer says: "I need--The Queen demands your help."
Shadow Weaver says: "I see."
Shadow Weaver says: "And what is it I can do?"
Glimmer says: "You know Catra best."
Glimmer says: "She's been two steps ahead this entire time."
Glimmer says: "Show me how to think like she does, so I can figure out her next move before anyone else gets hurt."
Shadow Weaver says: "You don't need to think like Catra."
Shadow Weaver says: "I told you you're more powerful than you know."
Shadow Weaver says: "Are you willing to use your power?"
Glimmer says: "And how, hypothetically, would I do that?"
Shadow Weaver says: "Magic, of course."
Shadow Weaver says: "A location spell is a simple but powerful tool for any young sorcerer."
Shadow Weaver says: "All it takes is a few ingredients..."
Shadow Weaver says: "and the will to see it through."
Glimmer says: "You've been growing magic plants this whole time?"
Glimmer says: "What do these do?"
Shadow Weaver says: "Those are daisies."
Shadow Weaver says: "I find them cheerful."
Shadow Weaver says: "Now, the final ingredient, added by the spellcaster."
Glimmer says: "Did I do that?"
Shadow Weaver says: "Think about what you're searching for."
Shadow Weaver says: "Keep it in your mind."
Glimmer says: "A secret outpost."
Glimmer says: "The Horde has been operating out of the Whispering Woods this whole time."
Shadow Weaver says: "Well done."
Glimmer says: "Oh, no."
Glimmer says: "Adora's looking in the wrong place."
Glimmer says: "If we can warn her in time, we can send her to the outpost and stop Catra once and for all."
Glimmer says: "But if Catra's tracking She-Ra, she'll know we're coming and clear out before we get there."
Shadow Weaver says: "Catra won't be expecting an attack."
Shadow Weaver says: "Her attention will be focused on Adora."
Shadow Weaver says: "It would be the perfect time to strike."
Glimmer says: "Are you suggesting I use Adora as bait?"
Shadow Weaver says: "As a distraction."
Shadow Weaver says: "But the decision is yours alone to make."
Shadow Weaver says: "What will you do, Your Majesty?"
Spinnerella says: "I don't see any sign of the Horde."
Adora says: "I can take it from here."
Adora says: "I'm not leaving until I destroy this bot."
Spinnerella says: "No."
Spinnerella says: "Princesses stick together."
Spinnerella says: "We'll find it."
Netossa says: "Ha."
Netossa says: "You wanna fight some bots."
Netossa says: "See, Adora?"
Netossa says: "She is just as competitive as I am."
Spinnerella says: "See, this is why no one comes to game night anymore."
Spinnerella says: "Adora, tell her."
Netossa says: "Maybe people don't come to game night because you insist on serving vegetable platters."
Netossa says: "No one likes vegetable platters."
Netossa says: "Right, Adora?"
Adora says: "Fall back!"
Catra says: "What are you doing back--?"
Catra says: "Oh."
Catra says: "It's you."
Glimmer says: "Who else would it be?"
Glimmer says: "Didn't anyone ever teach you to put away your toys?"
Glimmer says: "Otherwise, someone might come and break them."
Catra says: "You don't think I have more?"
Glimmer says: "I think most of your bots are busy with She-Ra, leaving you defenseless."
Catra says: "Using your own friend as a decoy?"
Catra says: "Wow, didn't know you had it in you."
Glimmer says: "Guess you don't know everything."
Catra says: "You even taste like glitter."
Glimmer says: "Where are you going, Catra?"
Glimmer says: "Not scared of some sparkles, are you?"
Catra says: "The Pulsebots are out vaporizing your friends, but I bet you'd like to see our upgrade."
Catra says: "We were saving it for a special occasion, but this'll do."
Glimmer says: "You're going to bring the whole place down."
Catra says: "Don't worry."
Catra says: "I'm not planning to stick around."
Catra says: "It's revving up to send out a pulse strong enough to level half the woods."
Catra says: "So you'd better choose."
Catra says: "Me, or the bot?"
Glimmer says: "Looks like I don't have to."
Double Trouble says: "Word around Bright Moon was that the Queen had disappeared on a mission."
Double Trouble says: "I thought I'd come check on you."
Catra says: "Double Trouble."
Catra says: "About time."
Netossa says: "I don't know how long I can do this."
Adora says: "Glimmer?"
Glimmer says: "Thought you could use some help."
Adora says: "Whoa."
Netossa says: "Spinnerella!"
Netossa says: "Spinnerella, please, talk to me."
Spinnerella says: "Fourteen."
Netossa says: "What?"
Spinnerella says: "That was 14 bots for me."
Spinnerella says: "I win."
Netossa says: "That's my girl."
Netossa says: "You win."
Glimmer says: "Should I start counting too?"
Glimmer says: "Because..."
Glimmer says: "I got the rest."
Glimmer says: "You should've seen me out there, Bow."
Glimmer says: "I was like..."
Bow says: "Sounds really cool."
Bow says: "But also, really awful?"
Glimmer says: "Ugh."
Glimmer says: "Come on, guys."
Glimmer says: "Can't we just enjoy this victory?"
Adora says: "This isn't over."
Adora says: "We still need to figure out how the Horde is tracking me."
Glimmer says: "But until we do, at least we can use it to our advantage."
Adora says: "By using me as a decoy?"
Glimmer says: "I know it was dangerous."
Glimmer says: "But it was the only chance I had to take out the rest of the bots before Catra could unleash them."
Glimmer says: "And it worked."
Glimmer says: "I'm not gonna stay behind anymore."
Glimmer says: "That's not the kind of queen I am."
Glimmer says: "I wanna be out there, fighting to protect my kingdom."
Glimmer says: "Side by side with my best friends."
Glimmer says: "And now that Shadow Weaver's teaching me magic, I'll be twice as effective."
Adora says: "What?"
Adora says: "Shadow Weaver's teaching you?"
Glimmer says: "Guys."
Glimmer says: "We won today, and no one else got hurt."
Glimmer says: "That's what counts."
Glimmer says: "Now, I'm gonna go raid the kitchen in celebration."
Adora says: "Glimmer."
Glimmer says: "I'll bring back some cake."
Double Trouble says: "Here's your stop, kitten."
Double Trouble says: "What are you going to yell your boss about all his shiny new bots getting blown up?"
Catra says: "I'm going to say, "You're welcome for testing them before we moved ahead with our big plan."
Catra says: "Obviously they were garbage."
Catra says: "" Hey, thank you, by the way for saving me."
Catra says: "I don't know what I would've done if you hadn't shown up."
Double Trouble says: "Well, I live to serve."
Double Trouble says: "For a price, of course."
Double Trouble says: "Marvelous."
Double Trouble says: "And don't worry, darling."
Double Trouble says: "I'll keep a better eye on Glimmer."
Double Trouble says: "Who knew she was so powerful?"
Catra says: "Heh."
Catra says: "Whatever."
Catra says: "If she hadn't used Adora as bait."
Double Trouble says: "Oh, yes."
Double Trouble says: "How devious."
Double Trouble says: "I'd assumed she was all glitter, no grit."
Catra says: "Yeah, that was unexpected."
Catra says: "And then she showed up alone."
Catra says: "Huh."
Catra says: "Looks like the friendship might have a few cracks, huh?"
Catra says: "Would be a shame if someone were there to take advantage of them."
