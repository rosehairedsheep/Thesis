Inside Bright Moon.
Glimmer Sighs.
Castaspella says: "Glimmer, come at once."
Castaspella says: "We need you in the War Room right away!"
Castaspella says: "There's no time to waste."
Castaspella says: "You must make a decision."
Adora says: "We're here for you."
Glimmer says: "That one!"
Castaspella says: "The Future Queen has spoken."
Castaspella says: "At Glimmer's coronation, we will be serving – ice cream cake!"
All laugh.
Theme plays.
Glimmer says: "People are starting to arrive."
Glimmer says: "I can't believe this is really my coronation day."
Glimmer says: "Me."
Glimmer says: "Queen Glimmer."
Glimmer says: "Ugh."
Glimmer says: "It sounds so weird."
Bow says: "Queen Glimmer."
Bow says: "Queen Glimmer."
Bow says: "Queen Glimmer!"
Bow says: "Yeah, that's going to take some getting used to."
Glimmer says: "I just..."
Glimmer says: "never thought it would actually happen."
Adora says: "Hey don't worry."
Adora says: "You've got me and Bow beside you all the way."
Adora says: "We'll make sure this day is perfect."
Glimmer says: "Yeah, you're right."
Glimmer says: "We've got this."
Glimmer says: "Do I look okay?"
Adora says: "Like a queen."
Castaspella says: "Here you all are!"
Castaspella says: "What are you standing around for?"
Castaspella says: "The guests are starting to arrive!"
Castaspella says: "Come on!"
Castaspella says: "There's so much to do!"
Glimmer groans.
Adora says: "I'm worried about Glimmer."
Angella being gone.
Adora says: "It's her coronation."
Bow says: "Angella?"
Adora says: "Off everything, yes."
Bow shouts.
Adora says: "Oh, there's a quest!"
We're great at quests.
Moonstone's power has been balanced between you and your mother since.
Bow says: "So, about that quest!"
Bow exclaims.
Castaspella says: "Oh, and you'll need this."
Glimmer says: "Oh, uh, they're, uh, fine?"
Plumerian man crying.
Glimmer says: "Aunt Casta, you don't..."
Glimmer, take us to the terrace!
Glimmer sighs.
Frosta says: "What do you think?"
Glimmer says: "This is going to be awful."
Frosta says: "Awful inspiring, right?"
Glimmer says: "I appreciate the idea."
Frosta says: "Oh, you need a bouncer!"
Glimmer says: "Wait, I didn't say bouncer."
Okay.
Castaspella says: "Glimmer!"
Glimmer says: "Uh..."
Glimmer says: "blue?"
Glimmer says: "What about purple?"
Castaspella says: "Excellent choice."
Glimmer says: "You fired him."
Castaspella says: "Oh, right."
Adora grunting.
Bow says: "Hmm."
Mermista groans.
Mermista says: "Wow, how did you know?"
Castaspella says: "Ah!"
Castaspella says: "Wonderful!"
Perfuma says: "What?"
Perfuma says: "No!"
Perfuma says: "Why?"
Frosta says: "Stop bothering Glimmer!"
Bouncer!
Swift Wind whinnies.
Adora says: "Hey!"
Perfuma sobbing.
Adora says: "yep, it's gonna be perfect!"
Adora says: "Don't worry!"
Adora says: "We will find it!"
Glimmer says: "Uh..."
Glimmer says: "I..."
Castaspella and Glimmer grunting.
Castaspella says: "Mermista!"
Castaspella says: "Vases!"
Mermista says: "Don't stifle my creativity!"
Castaspella says: "Uhg."
Castaspella says: "Please."
Glimmer says: "Fun."
Glimmer says: "Right."
Catra says: "Hordak."
Hordak says: "Plans?"
Catra says: "Whatever."
Fright Zone?
Entrapta who--.
Hordak shouting I told you never to.
Fright Zone again. Fortunately for you, my signal to Horde Prime went.
Adora says: "Wow, Glimmer!"
Adora says: "You look..."
Castaspella says: "Oh, my little Glimmer."
Well, almost time for your quest! Give me a tick and this robe will.
Glimmer says: "Of course."
Bow says: "Umm..."
Bow says: "Right!"
I talk to you real quick? I don't know where the lantern is! Glimmer.
Adora says: "Bow, calm down!"
Adora says: "Glimmer is a good friend."
Shadow Weaver says: "Hmm."
Sea Hawk whimpering.
Adora says: "Unfreeze him right now!"
Frosta grunting.
Perfuma says: "Hmmm!"
Glimmer wants. New queen, new era.
Frosta says: "Stop fighting!"
Mermista says: "Yeah."
Mermista says: "There."
Swift Wind laughs.
Bow sighs.
Adora says: "Oh!"
Queen Glimmer. And she'll be all, 'Swift Wind, why don't you sing the.
Swift Wind singing Queen Glimmer –.
It's your day – we're all excited for you -.
Perfuma to stop questioning your wise judgment?
Glimmer says: "What?"
Frosta says: "Where do you keep the blankets?"
Sea Hawk is whining about being frozen.
Glimmer says: "Why did you free..."
Glimmer says: "?"
Swift Wind says: "I have it!"
Mermista says: "Glimmer obviously disagrees."
Glimmer. She has a ton on her plate...
Glimmer says: "Everyone, just stop!"
Glimmer says: "Let's just get this over with."
Catra says: "What are you doing in here?"
Catra says: "You heard Hordak."
Scorpia says: "But she didn't betray us."
Catra yells.
Scorpia grunts.
Catra says: "Entrapta betrayed Hordak."
Scorpia says: "It's okay."
Scorpia says: "You can come out."
Emily beeps and whirs.
Scorpia says: "Hey there, Emily."
Scorpia says: "Don't worry."
I won't let anything happen to you.
She will be accompanied by two witnesses, Master Archer Bow, and.
Adora, She-Ra, Princess of Power. Let the light guide you and go.
Adora says: "So, quest!"
Adora says: "Heh."
Glimmer says: "Can we just do this, please?"
And we're bad at quests.
Bow says: "Wow."
Glimmer says: "Okay, what's with you guys?"
Stop acting like this!
Adora says: "Like what?"
Glimmer says: "Like-- Like-- Like this!"
Glimmer says: "Whatever."
Bow says: "Wait, look!"
All exclaim.
Chamber of Queens!
Adora says: "Look!"
Bow says: "That altar."
All gasp.
Adora says: "Is this part of the quest?"
Bow says: "Teeth!"
Bow says: "Giant Teeth!"
All shouting.
Glimmer says: "The lantern!"
Adora says: "Glimmer!"
Bow says: "Glimmer!"
Bright Moon's guardian roars.
Adora says: "The scroll didn't mention a giant angry monster living in the tunnels under Bright Moon?"
Bow says: "Come to think of it, I might remember some mention of a Bright Moon guardian that we'd have to subdue."
Adora says: "Bow!"
Bow says: "It was confusingly worded!"
Adora says: "We need to get out of here."
Adora says: "Come on, teleport us out!"
Glimmer says: "I-- I can't teleport!"
Adora says: "Glimmer!"
Bow says: "What?"
Bow says: "Why not?"
Glimmer says: "I haven't been recharging my powers!"
Bow says: "What!"
Adora says: "What!"
Glimmer says: "Recharging would mean taking the Moonstone's full power for myself."
Glimmer says: "It would mean..."
Glimmer says: "admitting that she's really gone."
Glimmer says: "Everyone is already acting like she doesn't matter."
Glimmer says: "It's like no one remembers her."
Glimmer says: "No one cares."
Glimmer says: "We're having a coronation because she's gone, and everyone is acting like it's a fun party and it's not."
Adora says: "Of course it's not."
Adora says: "I just thought talking about it..."
Adora says: "About her."
Adora says: "It hurts."
Adora says: "I'm supposed to take care of you, Glimmer."
Adora says: "It's the last thing she asked me to do."
Adora says: "I wanted to make today perfect."
Adora says: "But I..."
Bow says: "We just don't know what to do."
Glimmer says: "I don't know either."
Glimmer says: "But maybe we can still figure it out."
Glimmer says: "Together."
Adora says: "Whatever path you choose, we'll always be there, right beside you."
Glimmer says: "Even if that path leads to a giant crystal monster?"
Adora says: "Especially if the path leads to a giant crystal monster."
Bow says: "Nothing we can't handle."
Bow says: "We're great at quests."
Glimmer says: "Then come on."
Glimmer says: "Let's do this."
Adora says: "For the Honor of Grayskull!"
Bright Moon's guardian roars.
Adora grunting.
All exclaim.
Glimmer says: "Hey!"
Glimmer says: "Over here!"
Bow says: "Glimmer!"
Adora says: "Run!"
Glimmer says: "No."
Glimmer says: "I'm Queen Glimmer of Bright Moon, and you will leave my friends alone."
The Moonstone pulses.
Angella Hologram says: "Glimmer?"
Glimmer says: "Mom?"
Angella Hologram says: "Glimmer, You are walking in the footsteps of all those who have come before us."
Angella Hologram says: "Now, my darling, it's your turn."
Angella Hologram says: "I wish I didn't have to leave you."
Angella Hologram says: "But I know you will be all right."
Angella Hologram says: "Because you are Glimmer, and you are so, so strong."
Angella Hologram says: "I have done my best to prepare you to rule, but you were always ready to lead."
Angella Hologram says: "I am so proud of you, Glimmer."
Angella Hologram says: "I love you."
Glimmer says: "I love you too mom."
Bow says: "You okay, Your Majesty?"
Glimmer says: "As long as you two are with me, I am."
Glimmer says: "Now come on, let's get out of here."
Bright Moon citizens gasp.
Glimmer says: "This place looks amazing!"
Frosta says: "We wanted it to be perfect for you."
Perfuma says: "So we worked together to finish."
Mermista says: "That was my idea."
Castaspella says: "Glimmer, it's time."
Glimmer says: "I'm here today because Queen Angella, my mother, sacrificed herself to save Etheria."
Glimmer says: "We can't let her bravery be in vain."
Glimmer says: "But there's so much we still need to do."
Glimmer says: "Hordak is still in power, and we know there's an even larger Horde army out there somewhere."
Glimmer says: "We can't let them win."
Glimmer says: "It's time for us to take back our home."
Glimmer says: "Together we will push out the Horde, once and for all!"
All cheer.
Bow says: "Yeah!"
Bow says: "Wooo!"
Hordak gasps.
Catra says: "Hey, Hordak."
Hordak says: "What do you think you're doing?"
Hordak says: "How dare you."
Catra says: "Missing something?"
Catra says: "Looks like you're ready to listen."
Hordak says: "When I finish with you..."
Catra says: "Hey, cheer up, boss."
Catra says: "You said it yourself."
Catra says: "Big, bad Horde Prime got your signal."
Catra says: "Don't you want to conquer Etheria before he gets here?"
Catra says: "He doesn't sound like the type to accept failure."
Hordak says: "What do you want?"
Catra says: "We're done with your little vanity projects."
Catra says: "It's time to crush the Rebellion, for good."
Catra says: "And you're going to help me do that."
Catra says: "I think you and I are going to do great things together."
