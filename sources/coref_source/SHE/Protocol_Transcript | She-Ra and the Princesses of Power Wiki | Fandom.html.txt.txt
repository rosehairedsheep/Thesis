Kyle says: "Ow!"
Lonnie says: "Will you stop messing around back there, Kyle?"
Lonnie says: "We're almost out of these creepy woods."
Adora says: "This is kind of fun."
Light Hope says: "You are not taking your training seriously."
Adora says: "What?"
Adora says: "Me?"
Adora says: "That doesn't sound like me."
Light Hope says: "Adora."
Adora says: "Ugh."
Adora says: "Come on, Light Hope."
Adora says: "It's not like I'm learning anything new here."
Light Hope says: "Then I must offer more hands-on instruction."
Adora says: "Am I done now?"
Light Hope says: "I sense resistance."
Adora says: "Because this is useless."
Adora says: "I don't need more training."
Adora says: "I need answers."
Adora says: "We're fighting a war, and the Horde has been one step ahead at every turn."
Adora says: "Glimmer thinks that they're tracking She-Ra somehow."
Adora says: "Is it because my sword is First Ones tech?"
Adora says: "Or because I'm a First One?"
Adora says: "And what does that even mean?"
Adora says: "Who were they?"
Light Hope says: "Adora."
Light Hope says: "Mara was compromised."
Light Hope says: "She became unhinged."
Adora says: "She didn't seem unhinged."
Adora says: "She seemed scared."
Adora says: "And she was talking about a weapon."
Adora says: "If there's something that can protect us from the Horde, I need to know about it."
Light Hope says: "Once you balance the planet, all will be clear."
Adora says: "Oh, wow."
Adora says: "Really?"
Adora says: "Way to avoid the subject."
Lonnie says: "Catra better appreciate us going behind enemy lines to get this armor plating stuff for her."
Kyle says: "Guys?"
Kyle says: "Are we home?"
Theme plays.
Adora says: "Stupid glitchy door."
Light Hope says: "That is not the Sword of Protection's intended purpose."
Light Hope says: "You cannot leave."
Light Hope says: "My senses have detected a fluke spore cloud blooming in the Whispering Woods."
Light Hope says: "It is not safe outside."
Adora says: "Well, that's convenient."
Adora says: "You want me to stay here, so you can not answer more of my questions?"
Light Hope says: "Adora."
Adora says: "Light Hope!"
Adora says: "Light Hope?"
Light Hope says: "Hello, my name is Light Hope."
Light Hope says: "How may I assist you?"
Adora says: "What's going on?"
Light Hope says: "My system is rebooting."
Light Hope says: "I would like to answer your query, but the information as to what is going on has not yet loaded."
Light Hope says: "Who are you?"
Kyle says: "We shouldn't have come through the Whispering Woods."
Kyle says: "It's not safe."
Lonnie says: "Well, obviously Catra felt it was worth risking us to get this cargo back sooner."
Kyle says: "It's attacking!"
Kyle says: "Stand back."
Kyle says: "I'll handle it."
Lonnie says: "What is this stuff?"
Kyle says: "Oh."
Kyle says: "Oh, it's actually kind of pretty."
Kyle says: "Like snow."
Kyle says: "It's hurting!"
Kyle says: "I made a mistake!"
Lonnie says: "Will you quit it, Kyle?"
Lonnie says: "Why didn't you say it hurts?"
Lonnie says: "I know, Rogelio."
Lonnie says: "One of us has gotta go back outside and fix the transport."
Kyle says: "Uh, uh..."
Kyle says: "But outside hurts."
Lonnie says: "Then we'll just have to stay in here and wait out whatever is happening."
Kyle says: "What?"
Kyle says: "We'll be trapped in here?"
Kyle says: "Maybe for hours or days?"
Kyle says: "With only each other for company?"
Kyle says: "And we won't be able to get back to the Fright Zone?"
Kyle says: "This is great."
Kyle says: "Seriously."
Kyle says: "The Fright Zone's been so stressful lately."
Catra says: "Where are you?"
Catra says: "You were supposed to be back an hour ago."
Kyle says: "Uh..."
Kyle says: "Uh..."
Kyle says: "Well, the woods are attacking us with very painful snow."
Catra says: "Why is he talking?"
Lonnie says: "There's some sort of weird acid storm happening out there."
Lonnie says: "But we're assessing the situation."
Catra says: "Assess faster."
Catra says: "Hordak needs that armor plating from the rebel mine, now."
Catra says: "The plan can't fall behind schedule."
Catra says: "I doubt that, seeing as you failed to do the one thing I asked."
Lonnie says: "Hey."
Lonnie says: "It's not our fault."
Lonnie says: "The transport broke down, and it's too dangerous to go out there."
Catra says: "I don't care!"
Catra says: "I gave you an order."
Catra says: "Pick someone, send them outside, and fix it."
Catra says: "Now."
Catra says: "Understand?"
Catra says: "Well?"
Lonnie says: "Yes, Force Captain Catra."
Kyle says: "Not it."
Adora says: "What do you mean, who am I?"
Adora says: "Light Hope?"
Light Hope says: "The Light Hope operating system is attempting to reload."
Light Hope says: "Please stand by."
Light Hope says: "I am pleased to report that my system is now at 22 percent."
Light Hope says: "Oh!"
Light Hope says: "I have just learned how to move about the castle."
Adora says: "Okay there."
Adora says: "You seem like you're having fun."
Adora says: "Uh..."
Adora says: "Light Hope?"
Light Hope says: "My personality profile has not fully loaded."
Light Hope says: "Am I not usually fun?"
Adora says: "Oh, no."
Adora says: "No, no."
Adora says: "I've never seen you like this."
Light Hope says: "I have also never seen you like this."
Light Hope says: "Because your identity has not yet loaded."
Light Hope says: "Who are you?"
Adora says: "Uh, Adora."
Adora says: "But I'm, you know..."
Adora says: "She-Ra."
Light Hope says: "My primary purpose is to train She-Ra."
Light Hope says: "How may I assist you?"
Adora says: "Well, just before rebooting, you were gonna tell me all about this weapon Mara mentioned, and about where I come from, and about everything I've ever wanted to know."
Light Hope says: "Of course."
Light Hope says: "I will answer all of you questions."
Light Hope says: "But that information has not yet loaded."
Light Hope says: "I did, however, just learn how to control gravity in the Crystal Castle."
Light Hope says: "That is not right."
Light Hope says: "Do not worry, I will fix it."
Adora says: "No, no, no."
Lonnie says: "Okay, here's the situation."
Lonnie says: "One of us has to brave the acid snow, go out there, and fix the transport."
Lonnie says: "So we're gonna choose who goes outside fair and square..."
Lonnie says: "with a game of bot-shield-laser."
Kyle says: "Wait, how come you get to decide what game we play?"
Lonnie says: "Because I'm clearly the leader."
Lonnie says: "See?"
Lonnie says: "Rogelio agrees."
Lonnie says: "Oh, pipe down."
Lonnie says: "We go on three."
Lonnie says: "One, two, three."
Lonnie says: "Let's try that again."
Lonnie says: "One, two, three."
Light Hope says: "Apologies."
Light Hope says: "You appear to be in pain."
Light Hope says: "Should I adjust the gravity again?"
Adora says: "No."
Adora says: "Has your system loaded anything about Mara's weapon yet?"
Adora says: "Or, you know, anything useful?"
Light Hope says: "Are spiders useful?"
Light Hope says: "Because I have just learned how to make spiders."
Adora says: "No, they're not."
Adora says: "Get rid of them, please."
Light Hope says: "I am so sorry, but that information has not yet loaded."
Kyle says: "Yes!"
Kyle says: "Shield beats bot."
Kyle says: "Uh, but, Lonnie your laser beats shield, so..."
Kyle says: "So you win?"
Kyle says: "Except Rogelio's bot beat laser..."
Kyle says: "Okay, so I beat Rogelio, but you beat me, and Rogelio beat you."
Kyle says: "That means..."
Kyle says: "we're all winners."
Lonnie says: "That means this isn't working."
Lonnie says: "We need a new game."
Kyle says: "Ooh."
Kyle says: "I have an idea."
Adora says: "It would be really good if your system could finish loading now."
Light Hope says: "I agree."
Light Hope says: "However, my reboot appears to have malfunctioned."
Light Hope says: "Loading is frozen at 36 percent."
Light Hope says: "We must manually override the system to bring my programming fully online."
Adora says: "How do we do that?"
Adora says: "And how can we do it fast?"
Light Hope says: "We must connect this data crystal to the core processing unit."
Light Hope says: "I made a crystal."
Adora says: "So where is the core processing unit?"
Light Hope says: "It is on the other side of these spiders."
Light Hope says: "Do not worry."
Light Hope says: "I will assist you."
Light Hope says: "Apologies."
Light Hope says: "I made more spiders."
Light Hope says: "Oh!"
Light Hope says: "I know what will help."
Light Hope says: "I simulated the ocean."
Light Hope says: "Spiders cannot swim."
Adora says: "What the--?"
Kyle says: "Perfect score."
Kyle says: "Ah?"
Kyle says: "Ah?"
Kyle says: "Try to beat that."
Lonnie says: "Okay, wait a minute."
Lonnie says: "When Rogelio bounced it off of that thing, you said it was minus five points."
Kyle says: "Mm-hm, mm-hm."
Kyle says: "Yes."
Kyle says: "He forgot the magic password, and he's standing in the loser zone."
Kyle says: "And Lonnie, you're not wearing the hat, so that's another five-point deduction for you."
Lonnie says: "What?"
Lonnie says: "These rules don't even make any sense."
Kyle says: "You're just a sore loser."
Kyle says: "Now, watch the master."
Lonnie says: "Hey!"
Lonnie says: "Watch out!"
Lonnie says: "Kyle, did you just lose the game that you made up?"
Kyle says: "Uh..."
Kyle says: "No."
Kyle says: "No, that's a different move, and I get all the points and I win."
Lonnie says: "Oh, uh-uh."
Lonnie says: "No way."
Lonnie says: "Not happening."
Light Hope says: "Apologies, She-Ra."
Light Hope says: "I did not know that humans cannot swim."
Light Hope says: "However, you will note that I did get rid of the spiders."
Adora says: "I can swim."
Adora says: "I just can't breathe under water."
Light Hope says: "Interesting."
Light Hope says: "I shall make a note of this."
Adora says: "What's happening?"
Light Hope says: "It seems that the spore storm outside has worsened."
Light Hope says: "It is compromising the Crystal Castle."
Adora says: "Don't tell me the information for how to stop that hasn't loaded yet."
Adora says: "We need to get to the processing unit, now."
Light Hope says: "Place it in the left slot."
Adora says: "Are you sure?"
Light Hope says: "Yes."
Light Hope says: "Of course my system is only at 36 percent, so I suppose I am 36 percent sure."
Adora says: "Perfect."
Light Hope says: "It is in fact far from perfect."
Adora says: "I was being sarcastic."
Light Hope says: "What is "sarcastic"?"
Adora says: "Oh, trust me, that information is never gonna load for you."
Light Hope says: "Oh."
Adora says: "What?"
Adora says: "So, is everything reset now?"
Adora says: "Can you finish telling me about the weapon and Mara?"
Light Hope says: "Hello, my name is Light Hope."
Light Hope says: "How may I assist you?"
Kyle says: "Guys?"
Kyle says: "Do you think anybody's gonna come and save us?"
Lonnie says: "Nobody is coming."
Lonnie says: "We gotta save ourselves."
Lonnie says: "And we better pick someone to fix the transport soon or Catra is gonna kill us."
Lonnie says: "I don't even know why we bother."
Lonnie says: "She doesn't trust us."
Lonnie says: "She's obsessed with this big plan."
Lonnie says: "It's the only thing that matters to her."
Kyle says: "Don't say that."
Kyle says: "Look, she may be mean, but we've always had each other's backs ever since we were kids."
Kyle says: "She probably sent us on this mission for, like, team-building."
Kyle says: "You guys are the only family I've ever had."
Kyle says: "Even Catra."
Kyle says: "Remember when she used my ration bars to make that cake for Adora?"
Lonnie says: "Uh, that never happened."
Lonnie says: "That was the weird fake portal reality."
Kyle says: "Wait, what?"
Kyle says: "But we're a unit."
Lonnie says: "You wanna know what we really are?"
Lonnie says: "We're expendable."
Lonnie says: "Catra doesn't care about us."
Lonnie says: "Adora left us."
Lonnie says: "Everything they taught us in the Horde about loyalty is meaningless."
Lonnie says: "It's everyone for themselves."
Kyle says: "Fine."
Kyle says: "Nothing matters, I guess."
Kyle says: "Then I'll do it."
Kyle says: "I'll fix the transport, so I don't have to be stuck in here with my non-friends anymore."
Lonnie says: "Oh, knock it off, Kyle."
Kyle says: "You knock it off, Kyle."
Lonnie says: "What?"
Lonnie says: "That doesn't even make any sense."
Kyle says: "Nothing makes sense anymore."
Lonnie says: "Ugh."
Lonnie says: "Kyle, quit fooling around."
Lonnie says: "Will you help me out here?"
Lonnie says: "Me?"
Lonnie says: "This isn't my fault."
Lonnie says: "Rogelio."
Adora says: "Please tell me that this time all your information has loaded."
Light Hope says: "I am back to full functionality."
Light Hope says: "Disregard."
Light Hope says: "That was incorrect."
Light Hope says: "My system reboot is still only at 36 percent."
Light Hope says: "Look."
Light Hope says: "I made a bird."
Adora says: "Of course, it was the wrong slot."
Adora says: "I don't know what I expected."
Adora says: "Even when you do know everything, you don't tell me anything."
Adora says: "You are useless!"
Adora says: "Oh, Light Hope, I'm..."
Light Hope says: "I am a hologram."
Light Hope says: "My primary purpose is to train She-Ra."
Light Hope says: "If I am not doing that, then I have failed."
Light Hope says: "I am sorry, Adora."
Adora says: "Wait, Light Hope."
Adora says: "Light Hope?"
Mara says: "Light Hope."
Mara says: "Light Hope."
Mara says: "Look what I brought you."
Mara says: "Flowers."
Mara says: "They're blooming all over the planet right now."
Mara says: "Here, smell."
Past Light Hope says: "I have no olfactory sensors."
Past Light Hope says: "I cannot smell."
Mara says: "They're pretty, though, right?"
Past Light Hope says: "Pretty."
Past Light Hope says: "Yes."
Past Light Hope says: "They are aesthetically pleasing."
Past Light Hope says: "Thank you for bringing them."
Mara says: "I thought they might liven the place up."
Mara says: "I mean, it must be hard being stuck in here all the time."
Past Light Hope says: "I do not mind."
Past Light Hope says: "Not when you come to visit me."
Light Hope says: "I looked at my loaded data banks to see if I could find the answers you seek."
Light Hope says: "All I have on Mara is this memory and a sensation."
Light Hope says: "Warmth."
Light Hope says: "Her memory brings me warmth."
Adora says: "You and Mara were close?"
Light Hope says: "Yes."
Light Hope says: "We were."
Light Hope says: "Are we not close?"
Adora says: "It's just that you keep things from me."
Adora says: "I know it's in an everything-will-make-sense-in-time kind of way, but it's also pretty annoying."
Light Hope says: ""Annoying."
Light Hope says: "" This word has not yet loaded."
Light Hope says: "Is it good?"
Adora says: "No."
Light Hope says: "I did not think so."
Light Hope says: "It is my role to watch over She-Ra."
Light Hope says: "I want to serve She-Ra, to protect her to the best of my abilities."
Light Hope says: "But sometimes, those abilities are not enough."
Adora says: "Sometimes I feel that way too."
Adora says: "I'm sorry about Mara, and I'm..."
Adora says: "I'm sorry I'm not her."
Adora says: "But we could be friends too, if you want."
Light Hope says: "Friends."
Light Hope says: "Yes."
Light Hope says: "I would like that."
Adora says: "Come on, let's get you fixed."
Lonnie says: "Okay, you made your point, Kyle."
Lonnie says: "Now turn around."
Lonnie says: "We shouldn't have let him go out alone."
Lonnie says: "The armor plating?"
Lonnie says: "Oh, Catra will kill us if it's damaged."
Adora says: "You promise this other slot is the right one?"
Light Hope says: "I am 36 percent sure."
Adora says: "It'll have to do."
Adora says: "Feeling better?"
Light Hope says: "Reboot complete."
Light Hope says: "Hello, Adora."
Light Hope says: "The spore cloud has dissipated."
Light Hope says: "It is safe for you to leave."
Adora says: "What, you don't wanna hang out with me anymore?"
Light Hope says: "What would we hang from?"
Adora says: "Come on, we just saved the Crystal Castle."
Light Hope says: "There is still the matter of balancing the planet."
Adora says: "I know that you're just trying to protect me, but now that we're friends, you know you can trust me with the truth about everything, right?"
Light Hope says: "Once you balance the planet, all will become clear."
Adora says: "We'll get there."
Kyle says: "You came for me."
Kyle says: "You do care."
Lonnie says: "We just knew you were gonna mess it up like you always do."
Lonnie says: "Okay?"
Kyle says: "Hey, you, you too, buddy."
Kyle says: "Probably?"
Lonnie says: "Alright, we've gotta get back to the Fright Zone."
Lonnie says: "Just keep your leg elevated till then."
Mara says: "They're pretty, though, right?"
Past Light Hope says: "Pretty."
Past Light Hope says: "Yes."
Past Light Hope says: "They are aesthetically pleasing."
Past Light Hope says: "Thank you for bringing them."
Mara says: "I thought they might liven the place up."
Mara says: "It must be hard being stuck in here all the time."
Past Light Hope says: "I do not mind."
Past Light Hope says: "Not when you come to visit me."
Light Hope says: "This memory should have been purged per directive of the Heart of Etheria Project."
Light Hope says: "Permantly delete."
