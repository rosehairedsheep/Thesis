Adora says: "Okay, you've gone crazy, got it."
Adora says: "I'll just come back later."
Bow says: "The ball is a meeting for all the princesses of Etheria."
Glimmer says: "And a giant party!"
Glimmer says: "Dancing, food, fancy dresses."
Adora says: "Dancing?"
Glimmer says: "It only happens once a decade."
Glimmer says: "I've been waiting years for this!"
Adora says: "Uh, I'm only a princess sometimes, so are you sure I should even go?"
Glimmer says: "Of course!"
Glimmer says: "Every princess is invited!"
Glimmer says: "That includes you!"
Bow says: "Oh yeah."
Bow says: "It's all in the invite."
Adora says: "Okay."
Adora says: ""Rules for greeting the hostess."
Adora says: "Expected curtsy depth?"
Adora says: "Proper stair descending etiquette"?"
Bow says: "The ball has been going on for centuries."
Bow says: "There's a lot of really old etiquette stuff you gotta do before you can party."
Glimmer says: "But it's gonna be so fun!"
Glimmer says: "And Princess Frosta is hosting it this year in the Kingdom of Snows!"
Glimmer says: "Her magic is incredibly powerful."
Glimmer says: "She'd be a huge get for The Rebellion!"
Glimmer says: "Don't worry!"
Glimmer says: "I'll be with you and so will Bow since he's going as my plus one!"
Glimmer says: "Together, the three of us can handle anything."
Bow says: "About that..."
Glimmer says: "It's the best friend squad in action!"
Glimmer says: "Right Bow?"
Bow says: "I'm going with Perfuma."
Glimmer says: "What!"
Glimmer says: "?"
Theme plays.
Catra says: "I'm sick of this."
Catra says: "Shadow Weaver failed to get Adora and if Hordak finds out she'll take us down with her."
Catra says: "She's obsessed."
Catra says: "We need to think big picture."
Catra says: "It's time for someone new to take over."
Catra says: "Me."
Catra says: "So, you in?"
Scorpia says: "I'm hanging out in your room!"
Catra says: "Unfortunately, you're the only one I can trust around here."
Scorpia says: "Because we're best friends."
Catra says: "Stop being so you and help me think."
Catra says: "I have the beginning of a plan, but it's not enough."
Catra says: "I need to capture Adora so Shadow Weaver doesn't demote me."
Catra says: "I need to impress Hordak so he'll make me the new Shadow Weaver."
Catra says: "How do I do both?"
Scorpia says: "Why don't you try something at the All-Princess Ball?"
Scorpia says: "Every princess is gonna be there, so Adora probably will be too."
Scorpia says: "Ooh!"
Scorpia says: "This year's theme is Winter Wonderland."
Catra says: "How did you get your claws on this?"
Scorpia says: "They sent it to me."
Scorpia says: "I'm a princess."
Catra says: "You're a princess!"
Catra says: "?"
Scorpia says: "Yeah, you know."
Scorpia says: "The Horde crash landed in my family's kingdom."
Scorpia says: "We let them stay."
Scorpia says: "My family gave Hordak our runestone, the Black Garnet."
Catra says: "You're a princess?"
Scorpia says: "Oh man, I thought everyone knew."
Scorpia says: "I mean, it's covered in Force Captain Orientation."
Catra says: "I'm beginning to think I shouldn't have skipped that."
Catra says: "Okay, so you're a princess, and you're going to a princess ball."
Scorpia says: "Oh no."
Scorpia says: "I'm not going."
Scorpia says: "No."
Scorpia says: "No one liked my family, even before we joined The Horde."
Scorpia says: "I never really fit with the other princesses."
Scorpia says: "I made them uncomfortable and they don't like that."
Scorpia says: "They don't like me."
Catra says: "And that's exactly why you have to go!"
Catra says: "How dare they pretend they're better just because you're different!"
Catra says: "How dare they abandon people just because they don't fit into their perfect little lives!"
Scorpia says: "Yeah!"
Catra says: "How dare they take best friends and turn them into giant sword ladies who run off with people clearly inferior to you?"
Scorpia says: "You're telling my whole life with your words."
Catra says: "It's time to show those princesses a thing or two!"
Catra says: "You're going, I'm coming as your plus one and we'll make this a night no one will ever forget!"
Scorpia says: "Super Pal Duo is going to prom!"
New scene.
Bow says: "She asked and I said yes."
Bow says: "I didn't think it would be a big deal."
Glimmer says: "It's not."
Glimmer says: "It's fine."
Glimmer says: "I'm just surprised."
Glimmer says: "When did you two even talk about it?"
Bow says: "Oh, she was super slick."
New scene.
Perfuma says: "Wanna go to the ball with me?"
Bow says: "Okay!"

Bow says: "And Perfuma's cool."
Glimmer says: "Yeah, she's fine."
Glimmer says: "But we always go to events together."
Glimmer says: "We have our whole routine."
Glimmer says: "We wear matching outfits, we share inside jokes and then we eat ice cream afterwards."
Glimmer says: "It's our thing."
Bow says: "Well, there's nothing wrong with a new thing."
Bow says: "Look,  I gotta get ready."
Bow says: "We'll hang out with you guys there."
Glimmer says: "But I liked our old thing."
Adora says: "Glimmer!"
Adora says: "Good."
Adora says: "No time to waste!"
Adora says: "I then broke down the ballroom into quadrants and I'm familiarizing myself with targets."
Adora says: "Ask me anything."
Glimmer says: "Princess Frosta."
Adora says: "Ruler of The Kingdom of Snows, it's her first time hosting the ball,  has the biggest kingdom outside of Bright Moon, neutral in the fight against the Horde."
Adora says: "Allies with the Star Sisters who are friends with Mermista, but not Sweet Bee who is dating Peekablue as you can tell by the string."
Adora says: "Up means friends, down means frenemies."
Adora says: "And also, I made an obstacle course!"
Adora says: "I'm feeling good!"
Adora says: "I'm prepared for any and all possible scenarios."
Adora says: "I am so ready for this Ball."
Glimmer says: "Great!"
Glimmer says: "What are you wearing?"
Adora says: "I was just gonna go as She-Ra."
Adora says: "I mean, she has better hair."
Glimmer says: "Well, you can't go as She-Ra."
Glimmer says: "They have a strict no weapons rule."
Glimmer says: "Neutral ground and all."
Glimmer says: "So, you'll have to leave your sword at the door."
Adora says: "Ugh, how are there still more parts to this invite?"
Glimmer says: "You know what this means?"
Adora says: "That clothes aren't important and I should keep studying?"
Glimmer says: "It's makeover time!!"
Pop music plays.
New scene.
Adora says: "You gotta be careful and don't just lean it somewhere and don't keep it with the other swords or it might get confused!"
Glimmer says: "Adora, c'mon!"
Adora says: "Whoa."
Adora says: "Heh."
Adora says: "It's big."
Pop music plays over speakers.
Glimmer says: "The ball is one of our most ancient traditions."
Glimmer says: "A princess' first ball is a huge rite if passage."
Glimmer says: "Plus, the Kingdom of Snows is really big."
Adora says: "Which is why we need Frosta."
Adora says: "If she joins us, all the other princesses are sure to follow."
Adora says: "Here we go."
Adora says: "Hold for one, two and three."
Adora says: "That's Frosta?"
Adora says: "But she's like, 10!"
Frosta says: "I'm eleven and three quarters."
Glimmer says: "Revered hostess, we come into your hall under the ancient rules of hospitality, bringing greetings from Bright Moon."
Glimmer says: "And She-Ra, the legendary warrior."
Crowd chatters.
Frosta says: "You are welcome in the Kingdom of Snows under the ancient rules of hospitality."
Frosta says: "Leave conflict at the door and please enjoy the ball."
Adora says: "Thank you your--  majesty."
The guards move them.
Adora says: "Couldn't have mentioned that she was a little kid?"
Glimmer says: "You did all that research."
Glimmer says: "I assumed you knew."
Glimmer says: "You know what?"
Glimmer says: "It's fine."
Glimmer says: "There's plenty of time still to win her over."
Adora says: "Oh!"
Adora says: "There's Entrapta!"
Adora says: "Heh."
New scene.
Entrapta says: "Adora!"
Entrapta says: "Glimmer!"
Entrapta says: "Are you here to watch the social experiment too?"
Adora says: "Social experiment?"
Entrapta says: "Different groups are thrown together and forced to mingle."
Entrapta says: "Hierarchies form and break."
Entrapta says: "It's the perfect place to observe behavior."
Entrapta says: "And they have tiny food!"
Entrapta says: "Where's Bow?"
Entrapta says: "I wanna show him my new recorder."
Glimmer says: "He's coming later."
Entrapta says: "Why didn't he come with you?"
Entrapta says: "Aren't you two friends?"
Glimmer says: "Why would you think we're not?"
Entrapta says: "There he is!"
Entrapta says: "Bow!"
Glimmer says: "They're matching."
Glimmer says: "That's our best friend thing!"
Entrapta says: "Feelings seem to be getting hurt."
Mermista says: "Hey, I'm here too."
Mermista says: "Don't make a big thing out of it."
Glimmer says: "They're making up their own inside jokes?"
Glimmer says: "What?"
Glimmer says: "Is Perfuma his new best friend now?"
Mermista says: "Not gonna get into whatever is happening there."
Entrapta says: "People just walking around in circles."
Mermista says: "Or that."
Mermista says: "Look, have you seen--?"
Sea hawk says: "Oh hey, it's my crew."
Adora says: "So, Sea Hawk's your plus one?"
Mermista says: "No."
Mermista says: "He is just my ride."
Mermista says: "Okay?"
Mermista says: "Just."
Mermista says: "My."
Sea Hawk says: "I am her plus one."
Entrapta says: "This is the best social experiment I've ever been to!"
Mermista says: "Whatever."
Mermista says: "Do they have a kelp bar here?"
Sea Hawk says: "To the buffet!"
Sea Hawk says: "Adventu-- Oh hi, Bow."
Glimmer says: "That's so funny, Adora!"
Glimmer says: "What a funny inside joke the two of us just came up with!"
Perfuma says: "The She-Ra, Glimmer."
Perfuma says: "It's great to see you."
Bow says: "Perfuma was just telling me about a winged horse that ate all the apples in Plumeria and then flew away."
Bow says: "Sound familiar?"
Glimmer says: "Sure, whatever."
Glimmer says: "Isn't this fun?"
Glimmer says: "Adora and I are having such a great time here together, just the two of us."
Glimmer says: "Right, Adora?"
Bow says: "Okay."
Bow says: "Uh, we're gonna go say hi to people."
Bow says: "Wanna come?"
Glimmer says: "No, you guys go on."
Glimmer says: "We'll find you later."
Glimmer says: "I wanna hear the rest of this hilarious story that Adora was just telling!"
Adora says: "Oh, perfect."
Adora says: "Frosta's alone."
Adora says: "I'm gonna try to smooth things over with her."
Adora says: "Coming?"
Adora says: "Okay, never mind."
Adora says: "I'll be right back."
New scene.
Adora says: "Revered hostess."
Adora says: "I've come to apologize for earlier."
Adora says: "I was so rude."
Frosta says: "Yes, you were."
Frosta says: "But as you're only an honorary princess, you can't be expected to know better."
Adora says: "Your kingdom is truly beautiful Princess Frosta."
Adora says: "I'm honored to be here."
Frosta says: "Thank you."
Frosta says: "And now I expect you're going to ask me to join your Rebellion?"
Adora says: "You know about that?"
Frosta says: "Of course I do."
Frosta says: "Princesses talk you know."
Frosta says: "The snow peas and the cookies are touching."
Frosta says: "Do it right."
Adora says: "Princess Frosta, the Rebellion needs you."
Adora says: "Your kingdom is the largest and most powerful."
Adora says: "Your alliance could be the key to defeating the Horde."
Frosta says: "The Horde hasn't threatened us here."
Adora says: "Only because the Kingdom of Snows is so out of the way, it doesn't matter to Hordak right now."
Adora says: "Joining the Rebellion is your best bet."
Frosta says: "The kingdom of Snows has defended itself perfectly well for thousands of years."
Frosta says: "We do not need your help or your Rebellion."
Frosta says: "Please continue to enjoy the ball."
New scene.
Bow says: "Perfuma was just telling about a winged horse that ate all the apples in Plumeria!"
Glimmer says: "Where have you been?"
Adora says: "I told you, winning over Frosta."
Adora says: "Actually, scratch that, failing to win over Frosta."
Adora says: "Are you okay?"
Adora says: "Why does it bother you so much?"
Glimmer says: "It doesn't!"
Glimmer says: "Bow can hang out with whoever he wants."
Glimmer says: "I just  I never had that many friends, okay?"
Glimmer says: "It's always been just me and Bow."
Glimmer says: "But now, what if he likes his new friends better than me?"
Glimmer says: "What if everyone does?"
Adora says: "That's not gonna happen, Glimmer."
Adora says: "Trust me, Bow isn't the type to leave his old friends behind and neither am..."
Adora says: "..."
Adora says: "I."
New scene.
Adora says: "Revered hostess, you can't let them in."
Adora says: "They're from the Horde."
Catra says: "Revered hostess, Princess Scorpia was invited as per the rules of this ball."
Catra says: "Rules which I personally have the upmost respect for."
Adora says: "You do not!"
Frosta says: "Princess Adora."
Frosta says: "The rules state clearly that all princesses and their chosen guests are welcome."
Adora says: "They're up to something."
Adora says: "I can feel it."
Frosta says: "That's enough!"
Frosta says: "You look at me and see a child, but I have worked too hard to gain respect only to throw it away just because you feel they are up to something."
Frosta says: "For centuries the All-Princess Ball has been neutral ground."
Frosta says: "I will not dishonor that legacy."
Frosta says: "Scorpia is a princess."
Frosta says: "Princesses get plus ones."
Frosta says: "They stay."
Frosta says: "Teenagers."
Catra says: "Really, Adora?"
Catra says: "I'm shocked."
Catra says: "We're not breaking any rules."
Catra says: "Didn't you read the invite?"
Adora says: "I know you're plotting something."
Adora says: "From now until the second the ball ends, I'll be watching."
Adora says: "Wherever the two of you go, I go."
Catra says: "Suit yourself."
Catra says: "Have fun with following us!"
Adora says: "Glimmer, you get Scorpia, I'll take Catra."
Crowd gasps.

Scorpia says: "What?"
Scorpia says: "Sir?"
Scorpia says: "Garcon?"
Scorpia says: "What's in this?"
Glimmer says: "Bow!"
Glimmer says: "Wait up!"
Bow says: "Glimmer."
Bow says: "Hi."
Glimmer says: "There's something I need to tell you."
Glimmer says: "I know things between us have been weird all night."
Glimmer says: "So, I just wanted to say.."
Bow says: "It's all right."
Glimmer says: "I forgive you."
Bow says: "You forgive me?"
Bow says: "Glimmer, I'm allowed to hang out with other people."
Glimmer says: "B-b-but don't you see?"
Glimmer says: "That's how it starts!"
Glimmer says: "Then suddenly everyone has new friends and nobody needs me anymore."
Glimmer says: "And then, I'm all alone."
Bow says: "What are you talking about?"
Bow says: "You have me, plus Adora and everyone who joined the Rebellion."
Glimmer says: "That's what I'm talking about."
Glimmer says: "It used to be the two of us."
Glimmer says: "And now, everything's changing."
Glimmer says: "I don't want you to leave me behind."
Bow says: "No one is leaving you behind."
Bow says: "I wanted to hang out with you and Adora and Perfuma tonight."
Bow says: "But you're the one who keeps acting weird and leaving."
Bow says: "I know change is scary, Glimmer."
Bow says: "But that doesn't mean you get to take it out on me."
Bow says: "Now, if you'll excuse me, I am going to go get my cummerbund because it is freezing in here!"
Bow says: "We'll talk later, okay?"
New scene.
Entrapta says: "Princess Prom, hour two..."
Entrapta says: "37 minutes..."
Adora says: "Don't touch her!"
Entrapta says: "You're right."
Entrapta says: "This is a much better vantage point for my observations."
Entrapta says: "Hi Adora."
Entrapta says: "Have you met my new assistant?"
Entrapta says: "She brought snacks."
Catra says: "She stole my food then asked me to spy on people with her."
Catra says: "Is this what love feels like?"
Adora says: "Entrapta, she's from the Horde."
Adora says: "The people the Rebellion are fighting."
Adora says: "The Rebellion you're a part of!"
Entrapta says: "Oh."
Entrapta says: "Well, in that case we should keep a better eye on her 'cause she just walked away."
New scene.
Bow says: "Is that a--  Oh no!"

Crowd cheers.
Catra says: "I don't know about you, but I am having a blast."
Adora says: "Whatever it is you're planning, it won't work."
Catra says: "You sure?"
Glimmer says: "I got into a fight with Bow and he won't wanna be friends with me anymore and I don't know where Scorpia is!"
Adora says: "What?"
Perfuma says: "Have you seen Bow?"
Perfuma says: "He went to get his cummerbund, but that was a while ago, right about the same time that Horde princess left."
Adora says: "Wait, do you mean Scorpia?"
Adora says: "Glimmer, when did you last see Bow?"
Glimmer says: "A while ago."
Glimmer says: "Isn't he with Perfuma?"
Adora says: "No."
Adora says: "Perfuma says he's been gone this entire time."
Catra says: "Maybe my plan won't work."
Catra says: "But then again, maybe it already has."
Catra says: "Say, where's your friend, Bow?"
Adora says: "What did you do to him!"
Adora says: "?"
Catra says: "Nothing permanent."
Frosta says: "Princess Ball is a ceremony of unity."
Frosta says: "Violence is strictly forbidden."
Adora says: "You don't understand."
Frosta says: "I understand perfectly."
Frosta says: "As hostess, in accordance with the rules set down over the centuries, I hereby revoke your invitation."
Crowd gasps and shouts.
Frosta says: "Remain calm!"
Frosta says: "Stop!"
Adora says: "Glimmer!"
Adora says: "Catra has Bow."
Adora says: "You have to find him now!"
Adora says: "Catra."
Adora says: "What did you do?"
Catra says: "I did nothing."
Catra says: "Scorpia, Lonnie and Kyle on the other hand were very busy."
Catra says: "It was fun distracting you though."
Adora says: "This isn't a game!"
Adora says: "People are gonna get hurt!"
Catra says: "It's never been a game to me."
Catra says: "I'm after something bigger, and no one is going to stop me."
