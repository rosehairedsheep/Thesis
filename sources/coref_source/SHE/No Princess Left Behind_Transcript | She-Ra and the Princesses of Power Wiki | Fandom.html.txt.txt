Sword of Protection shimmers.
Catra says: "Check this thing out."
Catra says: "You've got to admit, Shadow Weaver, in a single mission, I inflicted more damage on the Rebellion than anyone else."
Catra says: "I succeeded where even you failed."
Hordak says: "Shadow Weaver."
Shadow Weaver says: "My Lord."
Hordak says: "I commend you on the capture of the Princess of Bright Moon."
Hordak says: "Queen Angella has been given until the mornings moonrise to surrender herself to our forces."
Shadow Weaver says: "Thank-you, Lord Hordak."
Shadow Weaver says: "I thought you would be please with my work."
Hordak says: "You have proven your worth to me."
Hordak says: "Today."
Catra says: "Your worth?"
Catra says: "I'm the one who brought back the Princess of Bright Moon."
Catra says: "Not you."
Shadow Weaver says: "You're under my command, Force Captain."
Shadow Weaver says: "Therefore anything you manage to do right is credited to me."
Catra says: "So, I do all the work and you get the glory?"
Shadow Weaver says: "Sometimes that just the way of things."
Glimmer groaning.
Shadow Weaver says: "Welcome to the Fright Zone, Princess."
Adora says: "Your Majesty?"
Queen Angella says: "I should never have let her leave this castle."
Queen Angella says: "And now, I'm faced with an impossible position."
Queen Angella says: "As leader of the Rebellion, how can I surrender myself to our enemy?"
Queen Angella says: "And yet, as a mother, how do I..."
Queen Angella says: "I'm going to accept Hordak's terms."
Queen Angella says: "Glimmer is all I have."
Adora says: "You can't."
Adora says: "We have no guarantee the Horde will hold up their end of the bargain."
Adora says: "We could end up losing you too."
Queen Angella says: "A rescue attempt is too risky."
Queen Angella says: "If we had She-Ra we might have a chance, but without the Sword of Protection..."
Adora says: "There has to be another way."
Adora says: "We can't just give up."
Adora says: "I can rescue them."
Adora says: "I know the Fright Zone."
Adora says: "I'll find a way to get them back."
Queen Angella says: "How are you going to do that?"
Adora says: "I..."
Adora says: "I don't know yet."
Adora says: "But I'll think of something, I promise."
Adora says: "I'll bring them home."
Adora says: "Huh?"
Adora says: "What are you all doing here?"
Mermista says: "We're the Princess Alliance."
Mermista says: "And the Horde took one of our own."
Perfuma says: "We're ready for our first mission."
Adora says: "Let's go get our friends back."
Kyle says: "Dinner rations, prisoner."
Kyle says: "Ow!"
Bow says: "Hey, what's your name?"
Kyle says: "Me?"
Kyle says: "You're talking to me?"
Bow says: "Sure."
Bow says: "Is that all right?"
Kyle says: "Uh, I guess, but no one ever talks to me."
Kyle says: "I'm Kyle."
Bow says: "Hey, Kyle, I'm Bow."
Bow says: "Can you do me a favor?"
Bow says: "Can you tell me where they're holding the princess?"
Kyle says: "Princess?"
Bow says: "She's my best friend."
Bow says: "No one will let me talk to her or even tell me if she's okay."
Kyle says: "I'm sure she's fine."
Kyle says: "Maybe."
Kyle says: "Or she's not."
Kyle says: "I don't know."
Bow says: "Do you know where she is?"
Kyle says: "No, that kind of information is classified."
Kyle says: "They wouldn't tell me."
Bow says: "You have to help me get a message to her."
Kyle says: "I, uh."
Kyle says: "I better be leaving now."
Bow says: "No, wait."
Kyle says: "I like your shirt!"
Bow says: "Kyle!"
Adora says: "Okay."
Adora says: "This is the Horde prison."
Adora says: "Glimmer and Bow are being held inside."
Adora says: "Entrapta, this perfume bottle is you."
Adora says: "Perfuma, you're the nail polish."
Adora says: "Mermista, lipstick."
Mermista says: "Ew."
Mermista says: "Do you know what that stuff is made of?"
Mermista says: "I'll be this knife."
Entrapta says: "I feel like Perfuma should be the perfume bottle."
Entrapta says: "That makes the most logical sense."
Perfuma says: "Maybe I could be a flower."
Sea Hawk says: "Could I be this miniature painted model of Bow?"
Adora says: "No!"
Adora says: "Those represent Bow and Glimmer."
Adora says: "And this one's mine."
Adora says: "Bow made them for us."
Adora says: "Okay, just..."
Adora says: "Everyone focus!"
Adora says: "Our entry point will be here, near the Horde's scrapyard."
Adora says: "It's close to the prison and lightly guarded."
Adora says: "Perfuma and Entrapta will access the security tower and wait for my signal to disable the lights."
Adora says: "Mermista will access the Fright Zone's sewer system."
Adora says: "She'll swim through the pipes into the building and open the door."
Mermista says: "I'm sorry, Mermista will what?"
Adora says: "I know it sounds bad, but your'e the only one who can breathe underwater."
Mermista says: "Super gross."
Adora says: "Sea Hawk and I will take up position by the entrance."
Adora says: "The two of us will neutralize any guards on patrol."
Adora says: "Entrpata and Perfuma will regroup on our position and the team will enter when Mermista opens the door."
Sea Hawk says: "Excellent plan."
Sea Hawk says: "Adventure!"
Mermista says: "Hm?"
Mermista shrieks.
Adora says: "Mermista should be in place now."
Perfuma says: "Adora's signal."
Entrapta says: "Fright Zone log, day one."
Entrapta says: "I can barely contain my excitement!"
Entrapta says: "Hahaha."
Entrapta says: "Hmm, the Horde's using an outdated wiring system."
Entrapta says: "It really would work so much better if I just consolidated these conduits and re-routed the current here..."
Perfuma says: "Entrapta?"
Perfuma says: "Now would be a good time for those lights."
Entrapta says: "Oh, right."
Horde guard says: "What happened?"
Adora says: "We go on three."
Adora says: "Ready?"
Adora says: "One..."
Sea Hawk says: "Forward!"
Adora says: "I said on three."
Sea Hawk says: "I got excited."
Adora knocks on door.
Sea Hawk says: "Where's Mermista?"
Adora says: "She must've gotten held up."
Adora says: "Come on, we need to secure the guards."
Perfuma says: "Entrapta?"
Perfuma says: "Entrapta?"
Entrapta says: "The subject appears to be harvesting scrap components, possibly for reuse."
Entrapta says: "Fascinating."
Perfuma says: "Entrapta?"
Perfuma says: "We're supposed to meet with the others."
Entrapta says: "I know, I was waiting for you."
Perfuma says: "Oh, how very considerate."
Perfuma says: "Let's go."
Entrapta says: "Ah, oh."
Perfuma says: "So we don't get separated."
Horde skiff hums.
Adora says: "Psst."
Scorpia says: "Halt!"
Scorpia says: "Who are you?"
Sea Hawk says: "Me?"
Sea Hawk says: "I'm the inspector."
Sea Hawk says: "I'm here to inspect all the things."
Scorpia says: "Inspector?"
Scorpia says: "Inspector, of course!"
Scorpia says: "I must have forgotten you were coming."
Scorpia says: "We're long overdue for an inspection, I do have to admit it, but I can assure you we are up to code."
Horde skiff hums.
Adora says: "Wha..."
Adora says: "?"
Adora says: "How did this happen?"
Adora says: "We had a plan."
Entrapta says: "Actually you kind of lost me at the perfume bottle."
Adora says: "Where have you two been?"
Perfuma says: "I tried to get here sooner but harmonious teamwork with Entrapta can be..."
Perfuma says: "a challenge."
Adora says: "This isn't a game."
Adora says: "It's the Horde."
Adora says: "Glimmer and Bow are being held captive in this building and now Sea Hawk is gone."
Perfuma says: "Okay."
Perfuma says: "All right, everyone calm down."
Perfuma says: "Maybe we could try a simple breathing exercise."
Perfuma says: "Deep calming breaths, hmmmm."
Adora says: "Come on, we're going in."
Mermista says: "Could you not?"
Adora says: "Huh?"
Adora says: "What happened to you?"
Mermista says: "Uh, the sewer happened to me."
Adora says: "We can't waste any more time."
Adora says: "Bow and Glimmer need us."
Mermista says: "Uh, can I get a thank-you?"
Adora says: "Thank-you."
Adora says: "We need to get to an information port."
Adora says: "I'll hack into the data base and identify the cell block Glimmer and Bow are being held in."
Mermista says: "Hey, where's the geeky princess?"
Adora says: "Don't worry."
Adora says: "We'll find Entrapta and Sea Hawk and we'll rescue Glimmer and Bow."
Mermista says: "I don't know, that sounds like a lot."
Mermista says: "But you know me, I'm totally up for anything."
Entrapta says: "Fright Zone log, day one continued."
Entrapta says: "Keypads appear in every corridor and are capable of giving status updates on multiple systems."
Entrapta says: "Wow."
Entrapta says: "Hello there little guy."
Horde bot powers up.
Entrapta says: "Well, hello to you too."
Glimmer mutters, magic thrums, she yells.
Shadow Weaver says: "I should warn you Princess."
Shadow Weaver says: "Any attempt to teleport through these restraints will only cause you pain."
Shadow Weaver says: "It seems my Black Garnet and your powers don't mix."
Shadow Weaver says: "Besides, your mother will be here soon."
Glimmer says: "I know all about you and your mind games, Shadow Weaver."
Glimmer says: "Adora told me, so save it!"
Glimmer says: "And, by the way, she's not a fan."
Shadow Weaver says: "But I'm not playing games."
Shadow Weaver says: "What I said about Queen Angella is true."
Shadow Weaver says: "She's coming to surrender herself in exchange for your safety."
Shadow Weaver says: "Oh, it's such a shame, the toll this rebellion has taken on your family."
Shadow Weaver says: "First you lose your father..."
Glimmer says: "She-Ra will stop you!"
Shadow Weaver says: "There is no She-Ra!"
Shadow Weaver says: "We have the sword."
Shadow Weaver says: "Not Adora."
Shadow Weaver says: "There will be no one left to stop the Horde."
Shadow Weaver says: "In a few hours Bright Moon will fall and Etheria will be ours to rule."
Glimmer grunts, her magic thrums.
Shadow Weaver says: "Oh, tsk-tsk."
Shadow Weaver says: "Careful now."
Shadow Weaver says: "It would be a shame if we had no princess to exchange for the Queen."
Sea Hawk says: "Well, you Horde types run a tight ship, I must say."
Sea Hawk says: "Everything seems up to code."
Sea Hawk says: "Yes indeed, entirely up to code."
Sea Hawk says: "You pass with flying colors."
Sea Hawk says: "Now, unless you have something else for me to inspect, I should get home to my inspector children."
Scorpia says: "You know, you look familiar."
Sea Hawk says: "Perhaps you've seen me, in your dreams?"
Scorpia says: "No, that's not it."
Scorpia says: "Princess Prom."
Scorpia says: "That's where I know you from."
Scorpia says: "I knew it would come to me."
Scorpia says: "You were with that mermaid."
Sea Hawk says: "She has a name you know!"
Sea Hawk says: "I mean, no, that wasn't me."
Scorpia says: "You're with the Rebellion."
Sea Hawk says: "Now, as a scrupulous inspector, threats  "Duck?"
Scorpia says: "Oh, where?"
Sea Hawk says: "Oh!"
Sea Hawk says: "Duck!"
Scorpia yells.
Entrapta says: "Hi."
Sea Hawk says: "Oh!"
Sea Hawk says: "That was a top-notch rescue."
Entrapta says: "To be honest I wasn't sure which one of you I was gonna hit."
Adora says: "Okay, I found Bow's cell, but I can't find Glimmer in here anywhere."
Adora says: "They must be holding her somewhere else."
Adora says: "This isn't good."
Perfuma says: "What should we do?"
Mermista says: "I'm not going back in the sewer."
Entrapta says: "It's okay."
Entrapta says: "This is my new friend, Emily."
Entrapta says: "I reprogrammed her."
Perfuma says: "Where have you been?"
Entrapta says: "Where have you been?"
Adora says: "It doesn't matter."
Adora says: "We're all together."
Adora says: "Let's finish this."
Entrapta low level screeching in excitement.
Adora says: "Bow's cell is in section B, level 20."
Adora says: "We'll get him out first then figure out where Glimmer is."
Adora says: "Entrapta, can you get us up there?"
Entrapta says: "Yes!"
Entrapta says: "I can."
Entrapta says: "I mean, maybe."
Entrapta says: "I don't know."
Entrapta says: "I'm definitely gonna try."
Entrapta says: "This is gonna be fun!"
Adora says: "Okay, Sea Hawk, Perfuma you're with me."
Mermista says: "I'll keep an eye on this one, in case she tries to befriend any more robots."
Sea Hawk says: "On to the rescue!"
Kyle says: "Bow."
Kyle says: "Bow!"
Bow says: "Kyle?"
Kyle says: "I'm supposed to be in the barracks."
Kyle says: "Lonnie made me cover her latrine duty."
Bow says: "What's going on?"
Kyle says: "I found out where your friend is being kept."
Kyle says: "Shadow Weaver has her in the Black Garnet chamber."
Bow says: "Oh, that sounds bad."
Kyle says: "Yeah, it's pretty bad."
Kyle says: "But she's alive, at least."
Kyle says: "Shadow Weaver is planning to ransom her in exchange for Queen."
Bow says: "Why are you telling me this?"
Kyle says: "I don't know."
Kyle says: "I guess, because your the first person who's ever listened to me."
Bow says: "I mean, I'm being held prisoner, so..."
Bow says: "I don't know that I have a choice, but sure!"
Lonnie gasps.
Entrapta says: "Whoops."
Entrapta says: "That's not right."
Lonnie grunts, yells.
Adora says: "Entrapta!"
Entrapta yells.
Perfuma screams.
Sea Hawk says: "Perfuma!"
Sea Hawk says: "Hmm?"
Adora says: "Hang on!"
Lonnie says: "You think you can just come back here?"
Adora and Lonnie grunting, yelling.
Adora says: "I need to save my friends."
Lonnie says: "We were your friends."
Rogelio roars.
Mermista and Entrapta scream.
Sea Hawk says: "Huh?"
Perfuma says: "Adora, are you all right?"
Adora says: "Thanks to you."
Sea Hawk says: "Great hit Perfuma."
Kyle says: "No one's ever, ever asked for my help before."
Kyle says: "People here don't think I can do anything right."
Bow says: "Um-hm."
Bow says: "That seems tough."
Kyle says: "Why am I telling you this?"
Kyle says: "I shouldn't even be here."
Kyle says: "I'm going to get into so much trouble if I get caught."
Bow says: "No!"
Bow says: "Wait, I mean  we're just talking."
Bow says: "How much trouble could you get in for talking?"
Kyle says: "Oh, you'd be surprised."
Kyle says: "I get in trouble for everything around here."
Bow says: "That doesn't seem fair."
Kyle says: "I know!"
Kyle says: "But then I thought how brave you are for wanting to save your friend."
Kyle says: "And maybe, if I helped you, you could be my friend too."
Bow says: "Uh, sure, friends, definitely."
Bow says: "We can be friends."
Entrapta and Rogelio yelling.
Lonnie yells.
Entrapta says: "Good team, geek princess."
Sea Hawk says: "Goodbye!"
Kyle yells.
Sea Hawk says: "Bow!"
Sea Hawk says: "We're here to save you."
Bow says: "Adora!"
Adora says: "Bow!"
Adora says: "Bow, where's Glimmer?"
Bow says: "Shadow Weaver has her in the Black Garnet chamber."
Bow says: "Adora, what are we gonna do?"
Adora says: "Come on."
Adora says: "Can you get it open?"
Entrapta says: "I just need a little more time."
Horde soldiers shouting.
Entrapta laughs triumphantly.
Adora says: "This vent system leads to where you can steal a skiff."
Adora says: "Each chamber needs to be sealed and purged before you can move on to the next one."
Adora says: "The doors will only stay open for a few seconds, so keep up the pace."
Bow says: "Adora, what are you doing?"
Adora says: "Don't worry about me."
Adora says: "I'm gonna buy you some time and find Glimmer."
Adora says: "Meet you there, okay?"
Bow says: "Adora!"
Adora says: "I surrender, take me to see Shadow Weaver."
Adora says: "Glimmer, I'm here."
Adora says: "Don't worry everything will be okay."
Adora says: "I'll save you."
Adora says: "What have you done to her?"
Shadow Weaver says: "Leave us."
Shadow Weaver says: "Report to the Force Captain barracks and pack your things."
Shadow Weaver says: "Now that Adora is back, there's no need for you there."
Catra says: "Seriously?"
Catra says: "After everything I've done for you, it's still her you want?"
Shadow Weaver says: "I said go!"
Adora says: "Shadow Weaver, I'll stay here with you willingly, but you have to let Glimmer go first."
Glimmer says: "Adora, no."
Adora says: "Glimmer, are you okay?"
Shadow Weaver says: "You are correct Adora."
Shadow Weaver says: "You shall stay willingly, because I am going to wipe your mind."
Shadow Weaver says: "You'll have no memory of She-Ra or the time you spent with the Rebellion."
Shadow Weaver says: "Everything will be as it once was."
Shadow Weaver says: "As for the Princess, once I'm done, you'll be happy to have her as your prisoner."
Glimmer says: "No!"
Glimmer says: "Adora!"
Adora yelling.
Bow says: "We need to go back for Glimmer and Adora."
Perfuma says: "We need to do what Adora said."
Perfuma says: "They'll make it out and we'll be ready with the skiff."
Perfuma says: "No princess will be left behind."
Adora moaning.
Glimmer grunts, shouts magic thrums.
Glimmer shouts.
Shadow Weaver shouts, groans.
Glimmer says: "Adora, are you okay?"
Glimmer says: "Do you know who I am?"
Adora says: "Glimmer."
Sea Hawk says: "We made it."
Sea Hawk says: "This way to the vehicle bay."
Emily whirs, clicks, beeps.
Entrapta says: "Wait."
Entrapta says: "Emily."
Perfuma says: "Entrapta!"
Perfuma says: "No!"
Glimmer shouts.
Adora says: "Glimmer, what's happening?"
Glimmer says: "I don't know."
Glimmer says: "I can't teleport."
Adora says: "What?"
Adora says: "Catra."
Adora says: "What are you doing?"
Catra says: "Take it."
Catra says: "This is not because I like you."
Adora says: "Catra, I..."
Catra says: "Just get out of here."
Adora says: "For the honor of Grayskull!"
Bow says: "There they are."
Glimmer laughing.
Bow says: "Glimmer."
She-Ra says: "Wait, where's Entrapta?"
Bow says: "Entrapta didn't make it."
She-Ra says: "What do you mean?"
Mermista says: "She's gone."
She-Ra says: "Well, then, we have to go back for her."
Bow says: "No, she's..."
Bow says: "She's really gone."
Adora sobs.
Credits Roll.
