[Opening Credits. Caption says: "The Show That Watches Back."
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Lounge."
[Scene says: "A show called Cop Department is on TV."
Announcer #1 says: "Cop Department is real."
Announcer #1 says: "The people you see are not actors."
Announcer #1 says: "Most of them aren't even people."
Fry, Bender and Leela sit slumped on the couch. The coffee table is filled with dishes, uneaten burgers and boxes of Chinese food. On the TV is a centipede-like alien with a blurred face.
Centipede man says: "C'mon, man, I didn't fire off no laser."
Smitty says: "Then why is there a smoking hole in your ceiling, sir?"
The camera points to the ceiling.
Centipede man says: "What?"
Centipede man says: "Crazy upstairs lady must've been shooting down."
URL says: "Sir, you're on the top floor of this particular domicile."
The alien's wife walks in.
Centipede woman says: "camera out of my house!"
Smitty says: "Sir, sir, put down the lamp."
The alien smashes the lamp.
Centipede man says: "OK."
Centipede man says: "OK, I'm co-operating."
Smitty says: "That's it."
Smitty says: "Now put up your hands."
The alien puts his 20 hands in the air and URL moves towards him, cuffs at the ready.
URL says: "Nice and slow."
URL says: "Aw, yeah!"
Smitty says: "And while you're at it, unblur your face."
Centipede man says: "Aw, man."
He unblurs his face. It wasn't a TV effect!
Leela says: "Hey, Bender, I thought you said you were in this episode."
Bender says: "Nah, this week I'm on Caught On Tape 3 'cause of what I did in the coffee pot."
Fry spits out his coffee. URL walks the alien out of the building.
Centipede man says: "I'm sorry, I'm really sorry."
Centipede man says: "I'm just going through some things."
Smitty opens the car door but the alien head butts him and runs into some bushes. URL lifts up a shoe.
URL says: "I'm goin' in!"
The Cop Department logo appears on the screen.
Announcer #1 says: "Cop Department will return, after these messages."
The picture changes to a traffic-packed New New York.
Announcer #2 says: "Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient?"
Bender says: "Shut up and get to the point!"
Announcer #2 says: "..."
Announcer #2 says: "where Old New York comes alive."
A woman looks around the street.
Woman says: "It's like stepping back stepping back into the year 2000!"
A cowboy riding a hover-moped and carrying a harpoon pulls up. More cowboys follow him.
Cowboy says: "Time for the mammoth hunt, dudes!"
They ride off and attack a robotic mammoth on the streets. It roars. A hot air balloon flies overhead carrying actors playing Albert Einstein and Hammurabi, who reigned around 2000BC, rather than AD.
Einstein Actor says: "Let's disco dance, Hammurabi!"
Hammurabi Actor says: "Dy-no-mite!"
They dance. The Past-O-Rama logo appears on the screen, a play on the title logo of an unpopular cartoon series from the early 21st century.
Announcer #2 says: "Located on the former site of Brooklyn."
Leela says: "Sounds like your kinda place, Fry."
Leela says: "Wanna go?"
Fry says: "Nah."
Fry says: "If I ever wanna go back to the year 2000 I'll just freeze myself again."
Bender says: "C'mon, Fry, I really wanna see it."
Bender says: "You know how I yearn for a simpler time."
Bender says: "A time of barn dances and buggy rides, before life was cheapened by heartless hi-tech machines."
Bender holds his hands to his ear units and shakes his head.
Bender says: "Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah..."
[Scene says: "Outside Past-O-Rama."
[Scene says: "The place has a Disneyland-esque theme to it and a slogan adorns a sign: "It's Da Boom!"
[Cut to says: "Past-O-Rama Street."
[Cut to says: "Bender, Leela and Fry walk around the streets, crowded with other tourists."
[Cut to says: "They pass shops such as 47th Street Butter Churns, Iowa Bagel Co."
[Cut to says: "and a cinema playing Star Wars 9: Yoda's Bar Mitzvah."
Fry says: "Cool, it's just like the good old days!"
A man jumps Fry with a knife.
Mugger says: "Give me your wallet or I'll cut you!"
Fry laughs.
Fry says: "Hey, Leela, get a picture of me being "mugged"."
He dangles his wallet in front of the mugger and Leela takes a photo.
Mugger says: "I'll take the camera too."
He takes it and runs out through an exit. Fry laughs until he realises what has happened. He clears his throat.
Bender says: "Learning is fun."
[Time Lapse. Leela points at a screen with "Dow says: "11,107" on it."
Leela says: "Ooh, ancient Wall Street."
The Dow drops to 7,539 and stockbrokers crowd around the windows.
Stockbroker #1 says: "No!"
Stockbroker #2 says: "I'm ruined!"
They throw themselves out of the window. The Dow goes back up to 11,108 and they fly back through the windows with jet-packs.
Time Lapse. The trio have joined a tour group. The guide is dressed in pre-20th century clothing.
Tour Guide says: "I direct your attention to this ancient and mysterious tablet which has yet to be deciphered."
He points to a parking sign. Leela turns to Fry.
Leela says: "Do you know what it means?"
Fry says: "Yeah, I asked a cop once."
Fry says: "It means "Up yours, kid"."
Bender puts his arms around Fry and Leela.
Bender says: "I gotta say I'm really enjoying the day out with you people."
Bender says: "Hey, a suicide booth!"
Bender says: "So long, suckers."
Fry says: "Uh, sorry, Bender, that's just a phone booth."
Bender says: "Oh."
Leela says: "What were they used for?"
Fry says: "In New York?"
Fry says: "Bathrooms."
Leela says: "Oh."
Leela says: "I-I'll be out in a sec."
She walks into the phone booth.
[Scene says: "Past-O-Rama XLIInd Street Subway."
[Scene says: "A guy with an afro stands next to some graffiti on the wall that just says "graffiti"."
[Scene says: "On the same wall are two signs, one advertising "Learn Spanglish" and the other advertising "Laser Tentacle Surgery" in AL1."
[Scene says: "Bender, Fry and Leela stand by a turnstile."
Leela says: "How does this work?"
Fry says: "I'll show you."
Fry says: "Whup."
Bender says: "Oh, it's a turnstile."
He hops over it and Leela follows with some fancy vaulting.
[Scene says: "Past-O-Rama Subway Train."
[Scene says: "Leela, Bender and Fry look around the messy train car."
Leela says: "What's this?"
Leela says: "Another bathroom?"
Fry says: "No, it's a mobile apartment with no rent."
He lies down on a seat and puts a newspaper over him. Bender hits him.
Bender says: "C'mon, Fry."
Bender says: "Get up!"
Fry snarls and turns away from him.
[Scene says: "Past-O-Rama Street."
[Scene says: "They walk out of the subway and head elsewhere."
[Scene says: "Past-O-Rama: Treasures of The Holy Tomb."
[Scene says: "The 20th century museum appears to be themed on Ancient Egypt."
[Scene says: "Leela reads a tour leaflet."
Leela says: "Wow!"
Leela says: "The burial chamber of the 20th century's greatest spiritual leader, Al Sharpton."
Bender looks at a glass case of jewellery.
Bender says: "Ooh."
Bender says: "Now this guy had taste!"
Leela says: "It says he was mummified in ceremonial vestments."
Fry says: "We sometimes called it a jogging suit."
[Scene says: "Past-O-Rama: Traffic Pavilion."
[Scene says: "Fry, Leela and Bender watch a holo-film of a busy Old New York street, packed with cars."
Narrator says: "The traffic jams of Old New York were a public forum of free interchange of opinions."
In the holo-film the cars honk their horns.
Motorist #1 says: "Move it, crap for brains!"
Motorist #2 says: "Bug off!"
Motorist #3 says: "Get home, bastard man!"
Narrator says: "..."
Narrator says: "which was powered by a tank of burning fossils."
Narrator says: "Here we see a 20th century assembly line where cars were constructed by primitive robots."
A metal door goes up and behind it robots dressed like cavemen bang car frames with clubs.
Robots says: "Ooga!"
Robots says: "Ooga!"
Robots says: "Ooga!"
Robots says: "Ooga!"
Robots says: "Ooga!"
Robots says: "Ooga..."
Bender says: "We've come a long way, baby!"
The walkway moves on.
Narrator says: "..."
Narrator says: "the stately 1992 Latoura."
Fry says: "Hey, my girlfriend had one of those."
Fry says: "Actually it wasn't hers, it was her dad's."
Fry says: "Actually she wasn't my girlfriend, she just lived next door and never closed her curtains."
Leela says: "Fry, remember when I told you about always ending your stories a sentence earlier?"
Fry says: "C'mon, let's sneak in for a closer look."
He peers in through the window. A man dressed in medieval clothes stands behind him.
Man says: "Sir, we don't touch the antiques."
Man says: "sir."
Man says: "You-- Oh!"
Man says: "I'm sorry."
Man says: "You work here."
Man says: "I should have realised from that ridiculous getup you're wearing."
Fry says: "Hey!"
Fry says: "This is from Miller's Outpo-- Uh, I mean, yeah, I work here alright!"
The man hands him some keys.
Man says: "Here, move this rust bucket outside behind St."
Man says: "Koch's Cathedral."
He moves away but takes one last look at Fry and laughs.
[Cut to says: "Car."
[Cut to says: "Fry and Bender climb in the front and Leela sits in the back."
Leela says: "Did you drive much in the 20th century, Fry?"
Fry says: "Nope."
Fry says: "Nice!"
Fry says: "Listen to that baby purr."
Bender says: "There's a baby in there, huh?"
Fry looks in behind him, in the rear-view mirror and behind him again.
[Cut to says: "Past-O-Rama: Traffic Pavilion."
[Cut to says: "The car lurches forward and smashes through the wall."
[Cut to says: "Past-O-Rama Street."

[Cut to says: "Past-O-Rama Street."
[Cut to says: "The car spins out of control past a three-card-monte-bot and finally crashes into something and comes to a stop."
[Cut to says: "Car."
[Cut to says: "The airbags inflate in the front and everyone groans."
Bender says: "I think I got whiplash."
Leela says: "You can't have whiplash, you don't have a neck."
Bender says: "I meant ass whiplash."
Fry says: "I'm just glad we hit something."
Fry says: "I thought we'd never stop."
He opens the door and gets out.
[Cut to says: "Past-O-Rama Street."
[Cut to says: "Bender and Leela get out too."
[Cut to says: "There is a big smoking dent in the front of the car."
[Cut to says: "They gasps when they see that Fry hit a another bending unit, which, except for a goatee, looks like Bender."
[Cut to says: "The bending unit rubs it's ass."
Bending Unit says: "Ow!"
Bending Unit says: "I think I got whiplash."
It falls unconscious.
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Lounge."
[Scene says: "Fry, Zoidberg, Leela and Hermes impatiently pace around the room while Bender sits on the couch reading a magazine."
[Scene says: "Fry looks at a clock."
[Scene says: "It changes from 6:24 to 6:25."
[Scene says: "Enter Farnsworth and Amy, wearing masks and work aprons."
[Scene says: "Farnsworth holds a blowtorch."
Fry says: "How's that robot I ran over?"
Farnsworth lifts his mask.
Farnsworth says: "We did all we could."
Fry gasps.
Farnsworth says: "Good as new?"
Farnsworth says: "Yes!"
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab."
[Scene says: "The staff are assembled."
Farnsworth says: "Leela, Zoidberg, the rest of you, this is Flexo."
Hermes says: "Sweet llamas of the Bahamas!"
Hermes says: "Except for that stylish beard, he looks just like Bender!"
Flexo hops off the worktop. His voice is exactly like Bender's.
Flexo says: "No duh, dreadlock, we're both bending units."
Bender says: "Hey, brobot, what's you serial number?"
Flexo says: "3370318."
Bender says: "No way!"
Bender says: "Mine's 2716057!"
They both laugh. Fry joins in then stops.
Fry says: "I don't get it."
Bender says: "We're both expressible as the sum of two cubes."
Flexo cheers and they high five.
Fry says: "So, uh, Flexo."
Fry says: "Sorry about crushing your body like that."
Fry says: "You OK now?"
Flexo says: "Well I don't feel as bad as you look!"
Flexo says: "Nah, you're great."
Fry says: "Well just let me know if there's anything I can do to make it up to you."
Flexo says: "Actually, your little stunt did a number on my back."
Flexo says: "You mind rubbin' it for me?"
Fry says: "Uh..."
Fry says: "sure."
He rubs Flexo's shoulders.
Flexo says: "Aw, yeah, that's it."
Flexo says: "Little lower."
He goes lower.
Fry says: "How's that?"
Flexo says: "Lower."
Flexo says: "Yeah that's gettin' it."
Flexo says: "A little lower though."
Fry says: "Uh, I can't get any lower than this."
Flexo says: "I'll say, you're rubbing my ass!"
He and Bender burst out laughing and high-five again.
[Scene says: "Outside Electric Ladyland Laptop Dances."
[Scene says: "A robot distributes leaflets directly from his hand."
Robot #1 says: "Hey, check it out here."
Robot #1 says: "Six beautiful devices."
Robot #1 says: "They know what you like and they'll do it to within a tolerance of one micron!"
[Scene says: "Electric Ladyland Laptop Dances."
[Scene says: "In the smoky strip club a Fembot fan dances with mechanical fans."
Robot #2 says: "Yeah!"
Robot #2 says: "Spin those fans, baby!"
Another robot whistles.
Robot #3 says: "Alright, mama!"
Robot #4 says: "Gyrate, baby!"
Flexo and Bender smoke cigars. Fry coughs.
Fry says: "I don't like this place."
Fry says: "It's 120 degrees and there's very little oxygen."
Bender says: "Shut up and hoot."
Bender says: "Hubba-hubba, she is built -- in Mexico, I believe."
Flexo says: "And that ain't silicon, it's tungsten."
Flexo says: "And plenty of it!"
Fry says: "Uh, yeah."
Fry says: "Look at that exhaust fan."
Flexo says: "Ew!"
Bender says: "Pervert."
Flexo says: "Yoo-hoo!"
He waves a dollar and puts it into the stripperbot.
Stripperbot says: "Thanks, moderate spender."
Stripperbot says: "Please select erotic transaction."
Flexo says: "Yeah, how 'bout a lap dance for my pal here?"
The stripperbot moves towards Fry.
Fry says: "Uh, no, no, that's alright."
Fry says: "Ow!"
Fry says: "Ow!"
Fry says: "Ow!"
Fry says: "Ow!"
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Meeting Room."
[Scene says: "The next morning Fry sits at the table wearing a neck brace and holding an icebag to his head."
Fry says: "I'm telling you, there's something about Flexo I don't like."
Enter Flexo and Bender.
Flexo says: "Hey, Fry, think fast."
Flexo says: "Get it?"
Flexo says: "It's chlorine!"
He and Bender laugh and leave. Zoidberg laughs.
Zoidberg says: "It's funny because it's poisonous!"
Fry says: "Yeah, keep laughing, brine shrimp, but he's bad news."
Fry says: "I regret ever running him over."
Hermes says: "Take a rage dump, man."
Hermes says: "He's no worse than Bender."
Fry says: "He's much worse."
Fry says: "He drinks and smokes and he posts naked pictures of me on the Internet."
Amy says: "That's Bender, alright."
Fry says: "I'm talking about Flexo."
Leela says: "Oh, I get it."
Leela says: "This is cute."
Leela says: "You're jealous of Bender's new friend!"
Fry says: "No, I'm not."
Fry says: "Mark my words: Flexo's evil."
Fry says: "He's the evil Bender."
Hermes says: "Rage dump!"
Farnsworth appears on the big screen.
Farnsworth says: "Good news, everyone."
Farnsworth says: "Report to my bedroom for a private exhibition."
Everyone exchanges worried glances with one another.
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Farnsworth's Bedroom."
[Scene says: "Farnsworth sits on his four-post bed and the staff and Flexo gather around."
Farnsworth says: "Everyone get in bed with me."
Farnsworth says: "I have something to show you."
Farnsworth says: "Feast your eyes on this!"
Everyone gasps.
Leela says: "It's beautiful."
Amy says: "And huge."
Fry says: "Can I touch it?"
Behind the curtains Farnsworth holds a big glowing atom.
Zoidberg says: "So what is it, already?"
Farnsworth says: "It's a single atom of jumbonium, an element so rare the nucleus alone is worth more than $50,000."
Bender says: "How much more?"
Farnsworth says: "100,000."
Farnsworth says: "That's why I hid it here, under my mattress."
Leela says: "Uh, Professor, can we discuss this somewhere else?"
Farnsworth says: "Why certainly."
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Farnsworth's Bathroom."
[Scene says: "Farnsworth sits in the bath still holding the atom."
[Scene says: "A toy scale model of the Planet Express ship floats in the bath with him."
Farnsworth says: "The atom sits atop this dimestore tiara which will be awarded to the winner of this year's Miss Universe pageant on the planet Tova 9."
Farnsworth says: "Your job is to deliver it, safe and sound."
Amy says: "Wow!"
Amy says: "When I was a little girl on Mars I dreamed of being Miss Universe."
Leela says: "That's kinda pathetic."
Amy says: "Aw, come on, Leela."
Amy says: "Deep down all girls wanna be Miss Universe."
Leela says: "Not me."
Amy says: "Really?"
Amy says: "Maybe it's just cute girls."
Farnsworth says: "Due to the atoms tremendous value, Planet Express would go bankrupt if it was stolen."
Farnsworth says: "Therefore we'll need to hire on additional security for the mission."
Flexo raises his hand.
Flexo says: "Oh, oh, oh, oh!"
Flexo says: "Mr."
Flexo says: "Professor, right here!"
Fry says: "Uh, maybe we should stick with people we know and trust."
Farnsworth says: ""Flexo's great," you say?"
Farnsworth says: "Well that's good enough for me."
Farnsworth says: "Welcome aboard, lad."
Flexo laughs maniacally.
[Scene says: "The ship speeds away from Earth."
[Cut to says: "Ships Cargo Bay."
[Cut to says: "Leela puts the atom in a transparent safe and locks it."
[Cut to says: "She turns around, holding a laser."
Leela says: "Space bandidos have been operating in this quadrant so you'll each take 8-hour shifts guarding the safe."
Leela says: "First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
Fry says: "Wait, hold on."
Fry says: "I don't like the sound of that."
Fry says: "Let's just go alphabetically."
Leela says: "OK."
Leela says: "First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
Fry says: "Wait, let's go by rank."
Leela says: "OK."
Leela says: "First Bender, then Flexo, then Fry."
Fry says: "Flexo outranks me?"
Flexo says: "That's "Flexo outranks me, sir"!"
He pokes Fry. Then some more.
Time Lapse. Bender's shift has started. He stands with his laser poised and rotates his head. The cargo bay door opens and Fry walks in. Bender points the laser at him.
Bender says: "Halt."
Bender says: "Who goes there?"
Fry says: "Don't point that at me."
Bender says: ""Fry" who?"
Fry says: "Look, I know Flexo's your friend but I don't trust him alone with the atom."
Bender says: "My God, Fry!"
Bender says: "Just 'cause the guy's got a beard you label him as evil?"
Bender says: "Well I got a label for you, pal: An ugly little word called "prejudice"."
Fry says: "I'm not prejudiced."
Bender says: "Ah, save it for the cross-burning, Adolf!"
Time Lapse. Fry is gone and Bender sits with his feet on the safe reading Pentiumhouse magazine. Enter Flexo.
Flexo says: "Keeping an eye on the safe?"
Bender puts down the magazine. He only has one eye.
Bender says: "You know it!"
He points at his other eye sitting on a crate the other side of the cargo bay, watching the safe.
Flexo says: "Well, looks like it's my shift."
Flexo says: "You lie down and go offline for a while."
Bender yawns.
Bender says: "Alright."
He picks up his eye and walks out the room whistling. The door closes behind him and Flexo laughs as he looks at the atom. Fry jumps out from behind a crate.
Fry says: "Caught you!"
Fry says: "I saw you looking at the atom!"
Flexo says: "So?"
Flexo says: "I look at lots of atoms."
Flexo says: "Shouldn't you be resting up for your shift?"
Fry says: "Oh-ho, you'd like it if I went to sleep, wouldn't you?"
Flexo says: "Whatever it takes to shut your yapper."
Flexo says: "Nah, I'm just kidding, you're a joker."
Fry says: "Yeah, well here's a funny joke: I'm gonna sit right here till it's my shift."
Flexo says: "Suit yourself, skinbag."
Fry says: "That I will."
Flexo says: "Good."
Fry says: "Good."
Flexo says: "Good."
Fry says: "Good."
Flexo says: "Good."
Fry says: "Good."
Fry says: "Good."
Time Lapse. Flexo sits with the laser, bored, while Fry paces up and down. Fry's watch beeps.
Fry says: "Well, that's eight hours."
He snatches the laser from Flexo.
Flexo says: "Yeah, eight hours of solid boredom."
Flexo says: "Nah, I'm kidding, you're a wonderful man."
He leaves and Fry sits down.
Fry says: "Finally, the atom is safe."
He falls asleep immediately.
[Scene says: "The ship flies towards Tova 9."
[Scene says: "Outside Miss Universe Pageant."
[Scene says: "The ship lands on a landing pad near a sign informing people that "Contestants May Not Exceed More Than 50% Implant"."
[Cut to says: "Ships Cargo Bay."
[Cut to says: "The ship shakes as it lands and Fry wakes up."
[Cut to says: "He screams."
[Cut to says: "The safe is broken and the atom is gone."
[Cut to says: "Leela runs in."
Leela says: "What is it?"
Leela says: "My God!"
Leela says: "Did you hear maracas?"
Fry says: "No."
Leela says: "Then it wasn't space bandidos."
Leela says: "Bender, lock down the ship."
Leela says: "Don't let Flexo escape."
Behind her, Bender wears a blue scarf.
Bender says: "Aye aye, Captain."
Bender says: "It appears that Flexo has outwitted us all."
Bender says: "Especially me..."
Bender says: "Bender."
Time Lapse. Leela and Fry look at the broken safe.
Leela says: "How could Flexo have stolen the atom?"
Fry says: "He must have used a sleep-ray on me."
Fry says: "Sleep-rays exist in the future, right?"
Leela says: "No."
Fry says: "Oh."
Fry says: "Then I must've fallen asleep."
Leela says: "Well you were sure right about Flexo being evil."
Bender peers around the doorway, the bottom of his face and his body obscured by the wall.
Bender says: "I locked down the exits but he may have already gotten away."
Leela says: "OK, thanks, Bender."
Leela says: "Let's fan out and look for him."
Bender says: "Roger that, I got a map of the ship right here."
He walks into full view carrying a big map that hides his body and lower face. Leela walks over to him.
Leela says: "Keep an eye on Fry."
Leela says: "We can't rule out the possibility that he did it."
[Scene says: "Ships Galley."
[Scene says: "Leela sneaks in with her laser at the ready."
[Scene says: "She flicks on the lights and positions herself by a cupboard marked "Emergency Supplies"."
Leela says: "Aha!"
She opens the cupboard but all that is in there is a clown suit.
[Scene says: "Leela's Quarters."
[Scene says: "Fry snoops around by a chest of drawers."
Fry says: "Aha!"
Fry says: "Uh, searching..."
Fry says: "hmm."
Enter Leela.
Leela says: "Fry?"
Leela says: "Why are you looking for Flexo in my underpants drawer?"
Fry says: "I didn't find him here 10 minutes ago so I thought it was time to check again."
Leela slaps his hand. Bender walks in with the map covering him again.
Bender says: "Well, he wasn't in the, uh, kitchen room."
Fry says: "Say, Bender, can I hold that map for a second?"
Bender says: "And leave me high and dry in case of a scavenger hunt?"
Bender says: "I think not."
Fry  pulls at the map but Bender holds onto it, with it still covering his face.
Fry says: "Give it up!"
They struggle for a bit and Fry eventually pulls it away, revealing Bender to be wearing his green turtleneck that covers his chin.
Bender says: "Alright, take it."
Bender says: "Sheesh!"
He leaves. Fry eyes him suspiciously.
[Scene says: "Ships Cargo Bay."
[Scene says: "Leela and Fry inspect the safe again."
Leela says: "Well, looks like Flexo got away clean."
Bender stands behind Fry wearing another scarf.
Bender says: "It's a darn shame."
Leela says: "He must have jumped ship with the atom the second we landed."
Fry says: "Or maybe, he never left at all!"
Fry says: "Wait a minute."
Fry says: "You're Bender."
Bender says: "Of course, who said I wasn't?"
Fry says: "But why were you wearing that scarf and the turtleneck and this fruity number?"
Bender says: "It's a little thing called "style"."
Bender says: "Look it up sometime."
He puts the scarf back on.
[Scene says: "Outside Miss Universe Pageant."
[Scene says: "A screen advertises the Miss Universe pageant tonight and the Miss Parallel Universe pageant tomorrow."
[Scene says: "Flexo runs into the building laughing."
[Scene says: "Miss Universe Pageant."
[Scene says: "Inside, the alien finalists are lined up."
[Scene says: "Bob Barker's head in a jar hosts."
Barker says: "Our ninth finalist, Miss Methane Planet, Halatina Smogmeyer."
Barker says: "And our tenth and final finalist, Miss Earth's Moon, The Crushinator."
The Crushinator rolls in and crushes some shoes.
Crushinator says: "Thank you, Bob Barker."
Crushinator says: "I'm as happy as a girl can be."
Crushinator says: "End statement."
Barker says: "Which one of these lovely womanoids will take home the atomic tiara?"
From the side of the stage Leela peers around the curtains and gestures to Barker.
Leela says: "Downplay the tiara."
Barker says: "Uh, we'll find out after these subliminal messages."
[Scene says: "Bob Barker's Dressing Room."
[Scene says: "The crew are with him."
Barker says: "So you lost the atom, huh?"
Barker says: "You're garbage, human garbage!"
Barker says: "Do you brain-dead space jockeys have any idea how much that thing is worth?"
Fry says: "100,000?"
Leela says: "200,000?"
Bender says: "200,001?"
Barker says: "You're closest without going over."
Fry says: "Well, uh, we'll be leaving now."
Fry says: "If you'll just sign this form saying you received the atom."
Barker says: "I'm not signing squat."
Barker says: "You find me that damn tiara before the pageant ends."
Leela says: "But, Mr."
Barker says: "Enough out of you."
Barker says: "I may be against the fur industry, but that won't stop me from skinning you alive!"
Barker says: "As long as no one wears the skin."
A woman wheels him out.
Leela says: "Well, gentlemen, it appears we're boned."
Flexo wanders past the open door.
Fry says: "Flexo!"
Leela says: "Get him!"
[Cut to says: "Miss Universe Pageant."
[Cut to says: "Miss Unnamed Planet #2856-B plays the William Tell overture on a bugle."
[Cut to says: "She stops and takes her hands away revealing the bugle to be her nose."
[Cut to says: "The judges give their scores."
[Cut to says: "Florp gives her an 8, Calculon gives her a 9 and Zapp Brannigan holds up a "Room 715" sign and shakes the keys to the room sexfully."
Flexo runs onto the stage followed by Bender, Fry and Leela. The women scream and Bender dives on Flexo.
Bender says: "Gotcha!"
They get up and fight, moving in an identical way.
Women says: "Fight!"
Women says: "Fight!"
Women says: "Fight!"
Women says: "Fight!"
Women says: "Fight!"
Leela points a laser at the two robots. They have their hands at each other's throats, covering any suspicious goatee that might help tell them apart.
Bender says: "Shoot him, he's choking me!"
Flexo says: "No shoot him, he's choking me!"
They struggle and beads of sweat trickle down Leela's face.
Leela says: "I don't know which one to shoot."
Fry says: "Flexo!"
Fry says: "Shoot Flexo!"
Bender and Flexo fence each other using their antennae and they break through a wall.
[Cut to says: "Dressing Room."
[Cut to says: "The contestants run away screaming, covering themselves with towels."
[Cut to says: "An Amazonian separates them."
Amazonian says: "Women-only room!"
She lifts them up.
[Cut to says: "Miss Universe Pageant."
[Cut to says: "A woman from the same species as the creature Zoidberg hooked up with in A Flight To Remember is in the middle of her rap."
[Cut to says: "Bender and Flexo fly out through the hole in the wall and knock her over."
[Cut to says: "They cover each other's chins again."
Leela says: "Alright, enough of this."
Leela says: "There's the atom!"
Bender says: "Aw, jeez."
Fry says: "Bender?"
Fry says: "You stole the atom?"
Bender says: "Yeah, but I can explain, it's very valuable."
Flexo says: "I saw him snatch it while Fry was asleep."
Flexo says: "That's why I ran to tell Bob Barker."
Fry says: "Whoa, whoa, wait a second."
Fry says: "You mean Bender is the evil Bender?"
Fry says: "I am shocked."
Fry says: "Shocked!"
Fry says: "Well not that shocked."
Leela says: "I'm sorry we suspected you, Flexo."
Flexo says: "Don't even bother."
Flexo says: "You people sicken me."
Flexo says: "I put my life on the line to guard that atom and this is how you repay me?"
Flexo says: "Well you can go rot for all I care."
Flexo says: "Nah, I'm just kidding, you guys are alright."
He walks off laughing.
Fry says: "I'm so confused."
Fry says: "The Bender I liked turn out to be evil and the Bender I hated was good."
Fry says: "How can I live my life when I can't tell good from evil?"
Bender says: "Eh, they're both fine choices."
Bender says: "Whatever floats your boat."
He takes out a cigar and smokes it.
[Scene says: "Backstage."
[Scene says: "Bob Barker reads a book the woman is holding."
[Scene says: "URL and Smitty drag Flexo in behind him."
URL says: "Is this the guy?"
Barker says: "Huh?"
Barker says: "Oh, yeah, that looks like him."
Barker says: "Whatever."
Barker says: "Take him away."
[Scene says: "Miss Universe Pageant."
[Scene says: "The contestants are all lined up ready for the winner to be announced."
Barker says: "Alright, let's put an end to this pathetic hoedown."
Barker says: "Brannigan, read the thing."
Zapp says: "And the winner is..."
He starts to open the envelope. Leela, Fry and Bender watch from the side of the stage.
Leela says: "It figures."
Zapp turns around.
Zapp says: "Huh?"
Zapp says: "Leela?"
Everyone applauds and a spotlight moves to Leela.
Leela says: "Wait, you're making a--  I feel like a princess!"
She starts to cry and walks onto the stage and waves to the applauding audience.
Zapp says: "Wait."
Zapp says: "What are you people?"
Zapp says: "Idiots?"
Zapp says: "I'm still going mano a mano with this envelope."
Zapp says: "There it is, Miss Universe."
Zapp says: "There it is, looking weird."
The tiara sinks into Miss Vega 4. Fry, Leela and Bender watch. Leela sighs.
Leela says: "I almost had that tiara."
Bender says: "Me too."
Fry says: "Well, you guys might both be losers but I just made out with that radiator woman from the radiator planet."
Leela says: "Fry, that's a radiator."
Fry says: "Oh."
Fry says: "Is there a burn ward within 10 feet of here?"
