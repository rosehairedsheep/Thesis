An owl flies over the Planet Express building, then under through a tunnel, to where the ship is.
Hermes says: "Planet Express delivery company roll call!"
Hermes says: "Captain Turanga Leela!"
Leela walks into the view carrying Nibbler.
Leela says: "Here!"
Hermes says: "Delivery boy, first class, Philip J."
Hermes says: "Fry!"
Nibbler spits out Fry.
Fry says: "Here!"
Hermes says: "Assistant Manager of Sales, Bender Bending Rodriguez!"
Bender says: "Here!"
Bender says: "Cerveza, por favor."
Leela pops open a bottle of beer with her teeth and hands it to Bender.
Hermes says: "Long-term intern, Amy Wong."
Amy says: "Here!"
Her long hair is burned off by Bender's flaming burp and looks exactly like her normal hair.
Hermes says: "Company physician, Dr."
Hermes says: "John A."
Hermes says: "Zoidberg."
Zoidberg pokes his head out of the fridge, with a sandwich in his mouth, and holding a bag with the words "Fry's lunch" on it.
Zoidberg says: "Huh?"
Zoidberg says: "I thought it was mine!"
Hermes says: "Bureaucrat Grade 34, Hermes Conrad."
Hermes says: "Is who I am."
Hermes says: "And now I am proud to present the owner and founder of Planet Express, Professor Hubert J."
Hermes says: "Farnsworth!"
Hermes steps out of the way.
Farnsworth says: "You're all fired."
The other Planet Express members gasp in surprise.
Hermes says: "Sweet bongo of the Congo!"
Farnsworth says: "In fact, you were fired two years ago!"
Farnsworth says: "That's when we were shut down by the delivery network."
Cut to "BOX" Network, with the B flickering to look like an F.
Farnsworth says: "Yes, I'm afraid the brainless drones who run the network canceled our license."
In an office, A grey haired man speaks in gibberish, a woman claps her elbows together, and a blond haired man hits himself in the eye.
Fry says: "We were canceled?"
Farnsworth says: "Oh, it's terrible."
Farnsworth says: "Just terrible."
Farnsworth says: "Well, clear out your desks and move along."
Farnsworth says: "Chop-chop."
A phone rings and Farnsworth picks it up.
Farnsworth says: "Yes?"
Farnsworth says: "I see."
Farnsworth hangs up.
Farnsworth says: "Good news, everyone!"
Farnsworth says: "Those asinine morons who canceled us were themselves fired for incompetence."
Staff says: "Woohoo!"
Zoidberg says: "Yahoo!"
Farnsworth says: "And not just fired, but beaten up, too."
Farnsworth says: "And pretty badly."
Staff says: "Woo!"
Farnsworth says: "In fact, most of them died from their injuries."
Staff says: "Woo?"
Farnsworth says: "And then they were ground up into a fine pink powder."
Fry says: "Why?"
Farnsworth says: "Oh, it's got a million and one uses."
Farnsworth puts some "Torgo's Executive Powder” in his trousers.
Farnsworth says: "Ahhh, that soothes the fire."
Leela stands behind a bunch of fans, blowing air at her.
Leela says: "So what does this mean for us and our many fans?"
Farnsworth says: "It means we're back on the air!"
The staff look at him blankly.
Farnsworth says: "Yes, flying on the air in our mighty spaceship!"
Staff says: "Woooohoooo!"
Zoidberg says: "Yayyy!"
Bender says: "We're back, baby!"
Crew parties. Bender is limboing.
All says: "Party!"
All says: "Go, go, go!"
Cubert says: "Lower, lawn mower!"
Hermes says: "What's the matter, robot?"
Hermes says: "You got a rod up your spine?"
Bender says: "Yes, I do."
Bender says: "That's how I'm built."
All says: "Hooray."
Fry says: "Way to bend it!"
Bender says: "You're the greatest, Bender!"
Hermes says: "In Jamaica, we got 10-story office buildings lower than that."
Leela says: "Let's see you beat it, Rastaman."
Staff says: "Ooooohh..."
Hermes rips off his shirt.
Hermes says: "Let's make it interesting."
Hermes says: "Fetch down one of them sabers."
Fry and Leela fetch down one of the sabers hanging above a fireplace.
Bender says: "Oh, flexible."
Bender says: "That would go good up my spine."
Scruffy changes the music to a Jamaican version of the "Sabre Dance" as Hermes easily limbos under the sword.
Hermes says: "Lower."
Hermes limbos under the sword again, and the sword cuts the tip of his belly with blood.
Bender says: "The fat guy wins!"
Fry says: "Go, Hermes!"
Hermes says: "That's why they call me 11-inch Conrad."
The remaining sword hanging from the fireplace drops down, cutting Hermes' head from his neck. Hermes screams.
Scruffy says: "Oh, no."
Hermes' body then proceeds to stumble around, fall of the ledge and hit the ship's landing gear. The ship then crushes him.
An ambulance goes down the street, followed by the opening credits.
Opening credits.
[Title caption says: "It just won't stay dead!"
The opening credits include the primary characters appearing in the middle of the screen, each one after the other.
Phillip J. Fry Fry looks at the screen and smiles, one of his teeth fall out;.
Turanga Leela Leela blows smoke off a laser;.
Bender Bending Rodríguez Bender rides up a cliff on a horse;.
Amy Wong Amy dances to the Futurama theme;.
Dr. John A. Zoidberg Zoidberg clicks his claws to the Futurama theme;.
Professor Hubert J. Farnsworth Farnsworth looks around, then walks offscreen;.
And introducing Zylex A yellow monster with big yellow teeth is shown.
Fry says: "Can you save Hermes, Dr."
Fry says: "Goodensexy?"
Dr. Cahill says: "I told you, my name is Dr."
Dr. Cahill says: "Cahill."
Hermes' head is sitting on a pedestal.
Hermes says: "Figures I'd get mangled while the blonde bimbo's on duty."
Dr. Cahill says: "I'm a doctor, sir."
Dr. Cahill says: "The mere fact that I'm blonde and have a breathy voice, full sensual lips, and a steaming hot body doesn't make me a bimbo."
Zoidberg says: "Tell me about it."
Hermes says: "I think we've all learned a thing or two about sexual stereotypes."
Hermes says: "While my head's slowly dying 'cause I'm not in a jar yet, you bimbo!"
Dr. Cahill says: "Oh, right."
Dr. Cahill says: "Ditzy-witzy!"
Dr. Cahill says: "Lars, got another jar job!"
A man wearing a blue shirt with a mustache, beard, and no hair comes thorough the door with a cart.
Lars says: "Oh, sorry, Doctor."
Lars says: "I was disinfecting Courtney Love..."
Lars says: "Oh, hello."
Leela says: "What are you looking at?"
Leela says: "Is it the eye?"
Lars says: "Guilty as charged."
Lars says: "It's a nice looking eye, and there's plenty of it."
Leela says: "Oh."
Leela says: "Do I know you?"
Lars says: "Apparently not."
Lars says: "Hi."
Lars says: "I'm Lars."
Leela says: "Oh."
Leela says: "I'm Leela."
Leela says: "Nice to meet you."
Lars says: "Nice to be met."
Hermes says: "Pick up ladies on your own time, you shiny-headed goat!"
Lars says: "Sir, you're just a little enraged 'cause you're dying."
Lars says: "Up and away!"
A machine lifts Hermes' head into a jar, then fills the jar with H2OGfat.
Amy says: "Lars is so flirting with you."
Leela says: "He is so not."
Leela says: "He's just being polite."
Fry says: "Who does he think he is, being polite to you?"
Fry says: "You want me to beat him up?"
Leela says: "No."
Leela says: "Stop being so immature."
Fry says: "I'll show her who's immature."
Fry says: ""Charles de Gaulle"?"
Fry says: "Never heard of you."
Charles de Gualle's Head says: "I freed France from the Nazis and..."
Fry picks de Gaulle up and dances around with him, while talking in a bad French accent.
Fry says: "Hey, Leela."
Fry says: "I'm some French guy."
Bender says: "Rock that Frenchman, baby!"
Dwight and LaBarbara come in.
LaBarbara says: "Oh, my poor little love pirate of the Caribbean!"
Hermes says: "There, there, wife."
LaBarbara says: "Okay, look, Hermes, we got to think of the boy."
LaBarbara says: "He needs a daddy."
Hermes says: "He has a daddy!"
LaBarbara says: "No, he got two half-daddies."
LaBarbara says: "Will his body be all right?"
Dr. Cahill says: "Yes, but it may take a few days."
LaBarbara says: "No, not soon enough."
LaBarbara says: "Come, Dwight, let's find you a handsome new father."
Hermes says: "LaBarbara, no!"
Bender says: "It's okay, Hermes."
Bender says: "We're all here for you."
Farnsworth says: "Good news, everyone!"
Farnsworth says: "We've got a delivery to the nude beach planet."
Staff says: "Woohoo!"
Bender says: "So long, jerk."
[Scene says: "The PE ship takes off from the hanger of the PE building."
Leela says: "It feels great to be back at the wheel after two long years."
Fry says: "That's not the wheel."
Leela is holding a French horn. The ship plunges into a planet's atmosphere in front of three suns and into some water. A moment later the ship flies out of the water and lands on a nearby cliff, overlooking the nude beach.
Leela says: "It's nice out."
The crew starts stripping down.
Fry says: ""You must be at least this naked"?"
Fry says: "How much nakeder could you be?"
Zoidberg says: "Watch and learn."
Zoidberg strips out his shell and warbles around.
Fry gags.
[Scene says: "Nude beach crowded with all maner of life forms."
Bender says: "You know, it's funny."
Fry says: "What?"
Bender says: "Your wiener!"
Farnsworth says: "Well, I'm going in the water to prune up a bit before I strut."
Farnsworth says: "Who's with me?"
Amy says: "I'm in!"
Leela says: "I'm in."
Bender says: "Yeah, I'll go."
Fry says: "You guys go ahead."
Fry says: "I gotta find the bartender and deliver this box of barstool softener."
Fry says: ":Fry: Here's your package, sir."
Bartender says: "Why are you talking to my penis?"
Fry says: "Oh, sorry."
Fry says: "Sign here."
Bartender says: "Mind if I use your pen?"
Fry says: "Well, that's not a..."
The bartender uses fry's "pen" to sign, Fry screams OC.
Fry says: "And initial here."
Fry says: "Thank you for using Planet Express."
Leela says: "Hey, Fry, I didn't know you had a tattoo of Bender on your ass."
Fry says: "Me neither."
Bender says: "You got a tattoo of me?"
Bender says: "Neat."
Bender says: "It's like looking in a smelly mirror."
Farnsworth says: "So he's got a little ink."
Farnsworth says: "Big whoop."
Farnsworth walks away with a big tattoo on his back saying "THUG LIFE".
[Scene says: "Bender in a beach chair."
Bender says: "Sweet photons."
Bender says: "I don't know if you're waves or particles, but you go down smooth."
Nudar says: "Sir, would you care to sign our petition?"
Bender says: "I support and oppose many things, but not strongly enough to pick up a pen."
Nudar says: "That's just what the guys who oppose the things you support want you to do."
Bender says: "Really?"
Bender says: "Down with those guys!"
Fleb says: "And we'll need your e-mail address."
Bender says: "Hmm, they say you shouldn't give out your e-mail address."
Nudar says: "Right."
Nudar says: "That's just what those same guys say."
Bender says: "Them again?"
Bender signs "Bender@iloveBender.com" under "awong76@marslink.com" and "zoidberg@freemail.net".
The nude aliens are over by Leela and Amy.
Leela says: "I don't quite understand what this petition's about."
Schlump says: "Um,..."
Schlump says: "animals?"
Leela says: "Aw."
Leela signs the petition.
Schlump says: "And your e-mail address."
Leela says: "You won't send me any spam, will you?"
Nudar says: "Oh, no, no, no, no."
Nudar says: "Asterisk."
[Scene says: "Planet express lounge."
Leela's Wrist Thingy says: "You've got spam."
Leela says: "Spam, spam, junk."
Leela says: "The very last pygmy rhino is going extinct?"
Leela says: "Unless it gets my credit card number?"
Amy says: "Spam."
Amy says: "Spam."
Amy says: ""Hi."
Amy says: "How are you?"
Amy says: "" Oh, that must be from Kiffy."
Amy's computer says: "Hi, how are you?"
Amy's computer says: "Low, low prices on erectile dysfunction remedies, sleeping pills, old-person drugs, and antidepressants."
Amy is angry and speaking Chinese.
Amy says: "Antidepressants?"
Amy says: "Well, I certainly don't want to get depressed."
Amy's computer says: "Please enter credit card number."
Amy takes out a wad of cash.
Amy says: "Is cash okay?"
The computer literally sucks up the wad of cash & burps.
Bender is checking his e-mail inside of his head.
Bender says: "Porn."
Bender says: "Porn."
Bender says: "Free porn."
Bender says: "Get rich watching porn?"
Bender says: "I find that rather hard to believe."
Bender says: "Hmmm, scientists at West Johnson Pornoversity need test subjects to rate top quality roborotica."
Bender says: "Ooh, top-quality."
A "Scan for virus?" alert pops up.
Bender says: "Warning, perform virus scan?"
Bender says: "Pffft, I'm waiting for porn over here."
Bender repeatedly clicks "No".
Bender says: "Oh, yeah, come on, baby."
A virus downloads itself into Bender, and he starting babbling nonsense.
Bender says: "Roborotic..."
Bender says: "."
Zoidberg scuttles in.
Zoidberg says: "Friends, friends!"
Zoidberg says: "His Majesty Prince Adisaraki O."
Zoidberg says: "Zoidberg of Nigeria died."
Amy says: "That's so sad."
Amy says: "When will those antidepressants get here?"
Zoidberg says: "Wait, there's more."
Zoidberg says: "According to this e-mail, I, Zoidberg, am his next of kin."
Zoidberg says: "Once I wire some good-faith money to an overseas bank account, I'll inherit his kingdom, his canoe, and his plump young wife."
Hermes is sitting in a jar, which is being used as an umbrella stand.
Hermes says: "You dumb stumps."
Hermes says: "Don't you realize you're being scammed?"
Zoidberg says: "That is low, Hermes."
Zoidberg says: "Just because you don't have a body, you don't want anyone else to be prince of Nigeria."
Zoidberg says: "Well, try and stop me from wiring that money."
Zoidberg whoops and scuttles out, and runs into Farnsworth.
Farnsworth says: "What's going on here?"
Farnsworth says: "According to my illegal key logging software, you've all been giving out personal information over the Internet."
Farnsworth says: "If Hermes were here, he'd fire you all."
Hermes says: "I am here!"
Farnsworth says: "Quiet, you."
Farnsworth says: "In his absence, I'm calling a mandatory company security seminar."
Farnsworth says: "To the mandatorium!"
[Scene says: "conference table."
Farnsworth says: "Now, it's not hard to spot a phony Internet come-on."
Farnsworth says: ""Get rich quick x7 q"?"
Farnsworth says: "Phony."
Farnsworth says: ""Lose weight with space parasites"?"
Farnsworth says: "Phony."
Farnsworth says: "What's this?"
Farnsworth says: "I've won the Spanish National Lottery?"
Leela says: "No, it's a scam!"
Farnsworth says: "Yes, yes, a scam."
Farnsworth says: "My goodness, I'm rich!"
Farnsworth says: "And to think I didn't even know I had a ticket."
Farnsworth says: "I just need to wire some collateral to collect the winnings."
Hermes says: "Professor, stop!"
Hermes says: "You're giving away personal information!"
Farnsworth says: "I can afford to give away anything I want."
Farnsworth says: "I've won the Spanish National Lottery."
Amy says: "No, don't!"
Leela says: "It's a scam!"
Hermes says: "Why won't anybody listen to me?!"
Hermes says: "!"
Hermes says: "?"
Farnsworth says: "And my mother's maiden name and her bank account numbers and..."
Farnsworth says: "There!"
Farnsworth says: "I'm rich."
Farnsworth says: "Rich."
Farnsworth says: "Rich!"
Door bell rings.
Farnsworth says: "That must be my $400 now."
Farnsworth says: "Hello."
Farnsworth says: "Or should I say, '"Buenos dias"?"
Nudar says: "Hi."
Nudar says: "We own your company now."
He shows Farnsworth the e-contract he just e-signatured.
Farnsworth says: "Hwhaa?"
Bender says: "I'll deal with these guys."
Bender says: "Welcome, boss."
Amy says: "Hey, what the hell?"
Nudar says: "Guess I was wrong."
Nudar says: "There was a robot stupid enough to download the obedience virus."
Bender says: "I sure was."
Bender says: "Make a hole, chumps."
Bender says: "Presenting our new masters!"
Bender says: "Where shall I put these auto-dialers, kind master?"
Nudar says: "Between the password crank and the spamjaculator."
Nudar says: "Come on!"
Nudar says: "We've got a whole planet to scam."
Nudar says: "And bring me some more Gummi Fungus!"
Leela says: "We don't have to stand here and take abuse from a gross nerd."
Amy says: "Yeah!"
Fry says: "Yeah!"
Zoidberg says: "Yeah!"
Leela says: "Hi-yah!"
Leela launches a flying kick at Nudar, but Nudar pulls out a remote control. He turns a knob, and Bender glides over in front of Nudar, blocking the kick.
Bender chuckles.
Nudar says: "Now get back to work, you turkeys!"
Nudar says: "Planet Express is still in business."
Nudar says: "We've got crap loads of quote-unquote merchandise to deliver."
Fleb puts a paper crown on Zoidberg's head, while Schlump puts some gummi fungus into a jar labeled "ANTI-DEPRESSENTS".
Fleb says: "Ship them out, Your Highness."
Zoidberg says: "Finally, some respect."
Zoidberg turns around and hands the “anti-depressants” to Amy, who eats one.
Amy says: "I feel a little better."
Bender says: "Those marvelous scammers sure scammed us, huh?"
Leela says: "How can you just sit there kissing the aliens' butt flaps?"
Leela says: "Don't you realize you are totally under their control?"
Bender says: "Of course I realize it."
Bender says: "Does that mean I can't enjoy it?"
Bender says: "Hee hee hee hee."
Bender says: "Boy, were we suckers."
Lars walks in, carrying a jar with the plate "Hermes Conrad".
Lars says: "Greetings, earthlings."
Fry says: "Oh, hooray."
Fry says: "It's handsome Lars and his fabulous jars."
Lars says: "Hello, everyone who isn't Leela."
Lars says: "And a special hello to everyone else."
Hermes says: "Shut your lockers and get to class."
Hermes says: "How's my body doing?"
Lars says: "Oh, I'm afraid it's behind schedule."
Lars says: "The museum got tricked into giving all its funding to something called the Scamming Sciences Institute."
Bender chuckles.
Bender says: "It's a fake place."
Hermes says: "Cut to the chase, baldy."
Hermes says: "When do I get my me back?"
Lars says: "Well, it could be months, or even years."
Hermes says: "No!"
Hermes says: "That body's the cornerstone of my marriage."
Hermes says: "What's LaBarbara going to do?"
Amy says: "Spluh!"
Amy says: "She's going to go back to her first husband."
Zoidberg says: "Barbados Slim?"
Zoidberg says: "I love that guy."
A box of Bachelor Chow shows Barbados Slim dancing on the cover with his shirt off.
Hermes says: "Everybody loves Slim."
Hermes says: "He's the only man to ever win Olympic gold medals in both limbo and sex."
Lars says: "Well, maybe I should get going."
Fry says: "Yes, I'll show you out."
Amy says: "No, Leela will show him out."
Leela says: "No, Leela will show you out."
Leela says: "Me."
Leela says: "Leela."
Lars says: "So your friend, Fry, seems nice."
Lars says: "Are you and he dati--?"
Leela says: "Nope."
Lars says: "Good, because I was maybe thinking of asking you out for dinner."
Leela says: "Ohhhh."
Leela says: "I'll start maybe thinking about saying "Sure, when?"
Lars says: "Let me maybe give it some thought."
Both chuckle.
Lars says: "Tomorrow at 8:00?"
Leela says: "Okay."
Back at the lounge...
Fry says: "It's not fair."
Fry says: "I've loved Leela since the day I came to the future."
Fry says: "Did I show you the macaroni valentine I made for her?"
Amy says: "Yes."
Fry says: "Look at it again."
There is a heart-shaped piece of red construction paper with Fry and Leela on either side.
Fry says: "I know she thinks I'm immature, but someday I won't be."
Fry says: "And deep down in my heart, I know we'll end up together."
Fry says: "It's all there in the macaroni."
Leela says: "Lars asked me out!"
The Leela in the macaroni falls away, and the macaroni fry changes to a sad expression.
Bender says: "What are you doing, wonderful masters?"
Fleb says: "Sprunjing for information."
Nudar sprunjes a wall.
Nudar says: "Oh!"
Nudar says: "There's something here."
Nudar says: "I can sprunje it."
Nudar says: "Robot, tear it open!"
Bender says: "Goody, goody, goody, goody!"
Bender starts hitting the wall with his head.
Zoidberg says: "What's that thing on your neck?"
Nudar says: "Checking out my sprunjer, huh?"
Zoidberg says: "I guess."
Zoidberg says: "What does it do?"
Nudar says: "It's a special sense organ our species possesses."
Nudar says: "It engorges in the presence of..."
Nudar says: "Information."
Zoidberg says: "Lucky you."
Zoidberg says: "All I have is a gland that gives off foul odors when I'm bored."
A quiet spraying sound is heard, then the nudists, Amy, and the Professor all look at Zoidberg and cover their noses.
Bender finishes beating up the wall with his head.
Bender says: "Hey, look, a safe!"
Farnsworth says: "That's my safe."
Farnsworth says: "I call keep-offsies."
Nudar says: "No callsies!"
Nudar says: "Open it!"
Bender very gently puts his ear up to the door and turns the combination lock... only to punch right through the door and literally rip it off the wall.
Schlump says: "It's a gold mine."
Schlump says: "Tax forms, Social Security cards."
Schlump says: "Combination hair, blood and stool samples!"
The nudists start moaning.
Fry and Leela enter.
Fry says: "I don't get it."
Fry says: "How can you say Lars is more mature than me?"
Leela says: "Well, for one thing, his checkbook doesn't have the Hulk on it."
The nude aliens walk over to Fry, moaning and all.
Nudar says: "Who are you?"
Fry says: "Philip J."
Fry says: "Fry."
Schlump says: "Social Security Number 03280810?"
Schlump says: "Stool type, P-negative?"
Fry says: "That's right."
Nudar says: "I've never detected so much information before."
Nudar says: "I think it may be a Level 87 code."
Nibbler, watching from behind a crate, backs off whimpering.
Fleb says: "Level 87?"
Fleb says: "Can it be?"
Fleb says: "I thought it was only a legend, but the sprunjer never lies."
Nudar says: "It's in his pants!"
Fry says: "What the hell are you talking about?"
Nudar rips off the bottom of Fry's pants, revealing a tatoo of Bender smoking a cigar.
[Scene says: "The Professor's lab."
Nudar says: "Faster, faster!"
Farnsworth says: "I'm sciencing as fast as I can."
Farnsworth hits a button and the Bender tatoo appears on a screen.
Bender says: "What do you say, folks?"
Bender says: "Hot or not?"
Nudar says: "I'm not seeing any information."
Nudar says: "Do more things!"
Farnsworth presses a button the it magnifies to 10x. A binary code appears on the screen in Bender's eye.
Nudar says: "You, boogerbot, read the code or I'll shoot this guy."
Bender says: "Who the hell is he?"
Scruffy says: "I'm Scruffy, the janitor."
Bender says: "Hang on, Scruffy!"
Bender says: "Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, zero, zero, one, one, one, one, zero, one, zero, zero, zero, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, zero, one, one, one, zero, zero, one, one."
"God" says: "Huh?"
He shoots a tiny green ball towards Earth. The sphere appears in front of Bender and appears to be much larger than before.
Fleb says: "A time sphere."
Nudar says: "Naked brothers, we have sprunjed upon the universal machine language time code."
Nudar says: "The key to time travel!"
Leela says: "What's the secret of time travel doing on Fry's ass?"
Fry says: "It was bound to be somewhere."
Fleb says: ": Beyond this shimmering portal lie all the glories of history."
Nudar says: "And we can steal them!"
Nudar says: "We just go to the past and take stuff with our superior weapons!"
The scammers and Bender laugh evilly.
Nibbler rides in on a guinea pig.
Nibbler says: "Stop, you fools!"
Nibber swallows the guinea pig whole.
Amy says: "What's going on?"
Farnsworth says: "What is happening?"
Leela says: "Nibbler, you..."
Leela says: "You can talk?"
Nibbler says: "I can do more than talk."
Nibbler says: "I can pontificate."
Nibbler says: "You must not use the code of codes."
Nibbler says: "With each and every use, you risk tearing the universe asunder."
Amy says: "Oh, he's so adorable."
Fleb says: "The poodle-monkey may be right."
Fleb says: "The legend warns that the code is powerful and dangerous."
Nudar says: "My God."
Nudar says: "We'd better use it only three or four times."
Nudar says: "Six, max."
Nibbler says: "But even a single use could shatter the universe!"
Nudar says: "Got it."
Nudar says: "Two or three times."
Nibbler says: "I see I have no choice."
Nibbler says: "Nibblonians, attack!"
A squad of "Kitten-Class attack ships come crashing through the window, and start shooting lasers at the nude aliens.
??? says: "Hey!"
??? says: "That tickles."
Schlump says: "And the pitch!"
Schlump grabs a chair and swings it like a blernsball bat, striking an attacking Nibblonian ship.
Nibblonian says: "Mayday, mayday!"
Aliens says: "Hey!"
Aliens says: "Hey!"
Aliens says: "Hey!"
Nibblonian says: "Scamper!"
A nibblonian ship flies over Zoidberg's head, taking the "crown" with it, then hits a wall and explodes.
Zoidberg says: "Aawww..."
Nibbler says: "Alas, our kitten-class attack ships were no match for their mighty chairs."
Nibbler says: "The universe is doomed."
Nibbler says: "Doomed!"
Fry says: "Can I pull up my pants now?"
Nibbler says: "Dooooooomed!"
Nudar says: "Stand back you wing wangs."
Nudar says: "I'm gonna try out this timesphere with a quick test drive to yesterday."
Farnsworth says: "Bushwah."
Farnsworth says: "You can't go mucking about in the past without creating paradoxes."
Nibbler says: "I'm afraid he can."
Nibbler says: "It's a paradox correcting time code."
Nibbler says: "It all works perfectly."
Nibbler says: "Except when it rips open the universe."
Nibbler says: "Don't do it, I beg you..."
Nudar steps into the time sphere, Nibbler's voice fades out and everything outside is in slow motion.
Nudar says: "Yesterday please, and make it snappy."
Crew says: "wha???"
Door whooshes open off screen.
Nudar says: "Hello."
Nudar-2 says: "Howdy."
Bender says: "Hey!"
Bender says: "What the..."
Bender says: "?"
Crew gasps.
Zoidberg says: "There was one, but now there's two."
Nudar says: "Nothing gets past you eagle eye."
Nudar says: "I went back to last night and met the me of that time for a drink."
Nudar says: "One thing led to another and we ended up at my place, or should I say our place."
Nudar and Nudar-2 "kiss".
Leela says: "Blech."
Nudar says: "Oh come on, ya bunch of prudes!"
Farnsworth says: "This isn't merely revolting, it's impossible to boot."
Farnsworth says: "I know a paradox when I see one."
Farnsworth leans back on the smelloscope. A screw pops out and the scope crushes Nudar-2.
Farnsworth says: "Whaaa?"
Crew Gasps.
Farnsworth says: "Ahh, paradox resolved."
Farnsworth says: "Someone get a mop."
[Scene says: "a stack of domed houses."
[Scene says: "Dwight rings a door bell marked "Conrad"."
Dwight says: "You're looking well, pops."
Hermes says: "How can you look me in the eye 'n eye and say that?"
Hermes says: "I'm nothin' but a brain."
Hermes says: "A useless, filthy brain."
Barbados Slim says: "You forgot lice infested."
Hermes says: "I didn't forget it, I just chose not to..."
Hermes says: "."
Hermes says: "Barbados Slim!"
Hermes says: "What are you doin' here?"
Hermes says: "IS there somethin' goin' on between you two?"
LaBarbara says: "Oh no no no no, we jus' ah happened to run into each other shortly after your accident."
Slim says: "And every night since then."
Slim and LaBarbara laugh.
LaBarbara says: "You're so crazy."
Hermes says: "Woman!"
Hermes says: "No!"
Hermes says: "Ohh, who am I kiddin'?"
Hermes says: "Without my body, I'm a nobody."
LaBarbara says: "I'm sorry Hermes."
LaBarbara says: "But look at Barbados."
LaBarbara says: "You can't argue with those luscious pecks."
Hermes says: "No I can't."
Hermes says: "But I can ask him to stop wiggling them in my face."
Slim says: "I'm not wiggling them."
Slim says: "They do that by themselves."
Nudar says: "I think I'll go back in time and steal the Liberty Bell before it cracked."
Nudar says: "Or is the crack the valuable part?"
Farnsworth says: "I don't know, you naked crook!"
Fleb says: "We have a problem Nudar."
Fleb says: "It's a one way time code."
Fleb says: "It can take us to the past, but it can't bring us back to the present."
Bender says: "Oh oh oh oh oh oh!"
Bender says: "Masters, if I might, let me do the stealing."
Bender says: "I'll go to the past and snatch everything I can get my greasy mitts on."
Bender says: "Then, as a robot, I could just wait it out for a few centuries in the limestone cavern beneath this building."
Bender says: "Oh, it'll be ever so much fun."
Nudar says: "Hey, that's perfect."
Nudar says: "We sit back and let dum dum here do the stealing."
Bender says: "Dum dum away."
Bender says: "Zero zero one one..."
Bender says: "."
Nibbler gasps as Bender finishes reciting the time code. The time sphere appears and Bender jumps into it. A moment later, a trap door in the floor open and Bender emerges carrying a painting.
Leela says: "The Mona Lisa!"
Bender says: "Sorry, it's not quite finished."
Schlump says: ": Da Vinci give you any trouble?"
Bender says: "Let's just say he may not make it to The Last Supper."
Bender says: "Hahahahahaha."
Farnsworth says: "Preposterous twaddlecock!"
Farnsworth says: "Time travel is impossible."
Fry says: "But Professor, you time traveled yourself, remember, when we went back to Roswell?"
Farnsworth says: "That proves nothing."
Farnsworth says: "And furthermore, you'd think I'd remember a thing like that."
Farnsworth says: "Plus, who are you anyway?"
Bender says: "Man, this is fun on a bun."
Bender says: "Here I go again."
Nibbler says: "Oh no you don't."
Bender recites the time code.
[Scene says: "Egypt, 1351 BC - pan from Ramses' tomb, pyramids in the background, to 4 Egyptians carrying a sarcophagus."
Bender says: "Scarab, four arm, bird, bird, bird!"
[Subtitle says: ""Drop the sarcophagus!"
Bender says: "Boo!"
Bender says: "Hahahaha."
Bender says: "Naw, it's just me, Bender."
[Scene says: "Exterior, of PE building."
[Scene says: "Cut to Professor's lab."
Farnsworth says: "I must tell you Hedonismbot, I hate to sell my doomsday devices to a private collector."
Farnsworth says: "But with my business stolen I have to make ends meet."
Farnsworth says: "You will be careful?"
Hedonismbot says: "I shan't touch them till I've had Jambi lock the absinthe and ether away."
Hedonismbot says: "Ohhhh, what does this one do?"
Hedonismbot picks up one that looks like a lava lamp.
Farnsworth says: "Uh, that one kills everything everywhere."
Hedonismbot drops the device which rolls off the shelf. Sound of glass braking.
Hedonismbot says: "How delightful."
Hedonismbot says: "And this one?"
Hedonismbot holds up the spheroboom.
Farnsworth says: "Sir!"
Farnsworth says: "The sphereoboom is not for sale."
Farnsworth places the sphereoboom into a satchel and handcuffs it to his wrist.
Farnsworth says: "It's my sentimental favorite."
Hedonismbot says: "No need to explain."
Hedonismbot says: "I too have known unconventional love."
Hedonismbot says: "Perhaps you and I, and Jambi, could get together and compare notes sometime, eh?"
Farnsworth blushes and chuckles.
MC says: "..."
MC says: "resulting in peace between east and west coat rappers..."
The roof caves in.
MC says: "Good god!"
Bender in a flying saucer crashes down. Bender grabs the Nobel prize and check.
Bender says: "I accept this Nobel peace prize not just for myself, but for crime robots everywhere."
Bender says: "Skål!"
Bender takes off, audience claps. Cut to exterior of Sweedledome, Bender crashes out through roof in a different place. Cut to city scene - three fighter air craft pursue Bender, guns firing. Bender's flying saucer takes a hit, rocking it.
Bender says: "Not so neutral now, are you Sweden?"
Bender presses a button marked "Activate Decoys". Six duplicate saucers fan out behind his. Cut to interior of Applied Cryogenics, Fry frozen in his tube, old New York outside of window. Flying saucers fly over blasting everything in sight. Bender laughs maniacally.
[Scene says: "Leela's eye."
[Scene says: "Pull back, Leela is applying Torgos Executive Power eyeliner, She, Fry, and Hermes' head are on the couch in the PE lounge."
Leela says: "Be honest with me."
Leela says: "Does my eye look monstery?"
Leela says: "I don't want to look monstery for my date with Lars."
Hermes says: "At least a monster has a body."
Hermes says: "What I wouldn't give for Wolfman's torso, or any of the groovy ghoulies."
Leela says: "Ohh, I think I'll wear that slutty dress I've been saving for Easter."
Fry says: "I'd like to punch Lars right in his ruggedly good looking face!"
[Scene says: "Farnsworth is sleeping on a couch, clutching the satchel containing the spheroboom."
[Scene says: "The aliens look in the door."
Nudar says: "Like all rich people, we're gonna need weapons to shoot poor people."
Schlump says: "In self defense?"
Nudar says: "Yes, that too."
Nudar says: "Bender, go steal the doomsday device chained to the professor's wrist."
Bender says: "Never!"
Bender says: "Ha ha, I'm kidding."
Bender says: "You guys know I have to do whatever you say."
Nudar says: "Here, swap this for the real one."
Bender says: "Ahhh!"
Bender says: "The old switcheroo."
Nudar says: "Yes, but don't wake him."
Nudar says: "You'll need jeweler's tools and foot cup silencers."
Bender says: "Hey!"
Bender says: "I don't tell you how to tell me what to do, so don't tell me how to do what you tell me to do."
Bender says: "Bender knows when to use finesse."
[Scene says: "Nudar, door opens to reveal Bender with the satchel, a severed hand still attached to the handcuff, and a bloody hacksaw."
Bender says: "Here ya go."
Nudar says: "Put it in the safe, clanky."
[Scene says: "Bender at the safe."
[Scene says: "Take hand and discards it."
[Scene says: "Sounds of breaking glass and slap."
Zoidberg says: "Owww!"
Bender says: "Wheeeeeeee."
[Scene says: "exterior Dr."
Zoidberg says: "It's the damdest thing..."
Cut to Dr. Zoidberg's office where he's sewing Farnsworth's hand back on.
Zoidberg says: "..."
Zoidberg says: "there I was in the dumpster enjoying a moldy fudgesicle when suddenly your hand flies over and slaps me in the tokhes."
Farnsworth says: "Yes, well, these things happen."
Farnsworth says: "Fortunately the sphereoboom is still safe."
Opens satchel which contains a rose with a tag that reads "You've been scammed sweetheart".
Farnsworth says: "Scammed?"
Farnsworth says: "Me!"
Farnsworth says: "?"
Farnsworth says: "Sweetheart?!"
Farnsworth says: "!"
Farnsworth says: "?"
Farnsworth says: "Ohh!"
Throws satchel. Cut to hallway outside of office, Bender catches the satchel in his compartment and laughs.
Hermes says: "You do a nice hand job, Zoidberg."
Hermes says: "Tell me, If I could find an undamaged body, could you recapitate me?"
Zoidberg says: "Hermes, I'm a surgeon."
Zoidberg says: "When I see two body parts I sew them together and see what happens."
Hermes says: "Hmmm."
Hermes says: "All I'm askin' is for you to go back in time to when I still had my body and bring it back for me."
Bender says: "What do I do with your old head?"
Hermes says: "I don't care in the slightest."
Bender says: "Can do!"
[Scene says: "Zoidberg's office, Hermes' decapitated body is sitting on the gurney."
Hermes says: "Come on, mon!"
Zoidberg says: "Hermes, please."
Zoidberg says: "You can't hurry a delicate operation like this."
Hermes says: "Ohh!"
Hermes says: "..."
Hermes says: "Ug!"
Hermes says: "..."
Hermes says: "Argh!"
Hermes says: "..."
Hermes says: "Ahhhhhh."
Hermes says: "What are those?"
Pull back to reveal Hermes' head is on backwards.
Hermes says: "You incompetent crab!"
Zoidberg says: "I thought you were happy, your tail is wagging."
Hermes says: "Grrrrrr..."
Hermes says: "."
[Scene says: "exterior of Zoidberg's office."
[Scene says: "Door opens and Zoidberg rushes out whooping, followed by an angry Hermes."
[Scene says: "Farnsworth's lab, Farnsworth is using the finglonger to point to the equation E=9."
Farnsworth says: "I believe this paradoicality equation to be unsolvable, ergo time travel is impossible."
Farnsworth says: "But I can't quite prove it, Bubblegum."
Farnsworth says: "Perhaps you and your razzle dazzle Globetrotter calculus could..."
Bubblegum says: "Looks pretty damn solvable to me, Farnsy."
Bubblegum says: "Sweet Clyde, use variation of parameter and expand the Wronskian."
Passes chalk to Sweet Clyde who dribbles the chalk up to the board while the other Globetrotters whistle. Clyde writes an equation under the original then passes the chalk to the other trotters.
Farnsworth says: "Shizz, baby."
Farnsworth says: "So paradox free time travel is possible after all."
Bubblegum says: "Right on."
Bubblegum says: "But dig this multiplicand here."
Farnsworth says: "The doom field?"
Farnsworth says: "That must be what corrects the paradoxes."
Curly Joe says: "When that momma rises exponentially, it could rupture the very fabric of causality."
Nibbler says: "That's what I've been trying to tell you."
Nibbler gets kicked by Zoidberg who runs in, followed by Hermes. Hermes makes a wrong turn and collides with the black board and falls to the floor, gasping for breath.
Farnsworth says: "Hermes, you got your body back."
Farnsworth says: "Hurrah!"
Hermes says: "Yes, but not the original."
Hermes says: "Bender went back in time and picked up a copy."
Bubblegum says: "A copy!"
Bubblegum says: "Funky cold medina."
Bubblegum says: "According to this equation, a time travel duplicate results in a complex denominator in the causality ratio."
Sweet Clyde says: "Oh Snap!"
Sweet Clyde says: "Bet you know what that means."
Hermes says: "I can guess."
Hermes says: "Actually, I can't guess."
Bubblegum says: "Prof, you got a doom meter in this lab."
Fansworth picks up a device and scans Hermes. The device buzzes and chirps like a Geiger counter.
Farnsworth says: "Good Lord, Bubblegum."
Farnsworth says: "The duplicate body is emitting doom at ten times the back ground level."
Bubblegum says: "I thought as much."
Bubblegum says: "A duplicate body is always doomed."
Bubblegum says: "It's just a matter of time."
Hermes says: "I don't care."
Hermes says: "I just need it long enough to bird dog in an win LaBarbara back."
Bubblegum says: "Best bird dog fast my brother."
Hermes says: "That the way I bird dog best."
[Scene says: "Elzar's."
[Scene says: "Leela and Lars are at a table."
[Scene says: "Lars is holding a glass to Leela's mouth on a spoon as Leela laughs."
Lars says: "Drink, quick."
Lars says: "I can't balance it much longer."
Leela says: "Wait.."
Leela says: "I.."
Lars says: "Yes!"
Leela says: "This is so much fun Lars."
Leela says: "Most men are intimidated by the fact that I could kill them with the flick of my wrist."
Lars says: "Well not me."
Lars says: "'Cause if you do, you'll be stuck with the check."
Elzar says: "Folks, care for a little fresh ground executive?"
Leela says: "Please."
Elzar says: "Bam!"
Elzar yanks the spice weasel which emits a puff from it's nose onto Leela's dinner. A pink cloud forming a pair of interlocking hearts float up in front of Leela, framing their faces as they smile at each other.
Elzar says: "Don't get excited kids, this thing's got heart shaped nostrils."
Elzar says: "Want to see it make a star?"
Elzar turns the spice weasel around and lifts it's tail.
Leela says: "No!"
Lars says: "No!"
Montage of Lars and Leela playing outer space mini-golf, sitting in a hover car at the Cylon War Memorial at Makeout Point, and taking a soap bubble ride. In the latter, Fry, in another soap bubble with a bouquet of roses, sees Leela and Lars in an embrace. He thrown the roses away in disgust. The bubble pops and he drops screaming.
[Scene says: "PE building hanger, Bender come up through the trap door with a book."
Bender says: "Here's your Gutenberg Bible master."
Bender says: "Plus the Colonel's secret recipe: Chicken, Grease, Salt."
Fleb says: "Well, that does it."
Fleb says: "We've got every valuable object in history."
He tosses the bible over his shoulder, hitting Fry in the head.
Fry says: "Owww!"
Nudar says: "Hmm."
Nudar says: "Now that I'm rich I suddenly care if the universe gets destroyed."
Nudar says: "We can't use that dangerous time code again."
Nudar says: "Blank it from the robot's memory."
Fleb holds up a head cleaner cassette. Bender opens his mouth.
Bender says: "Ahhhhh."
Nudar says: "I'll vaporize this guy so his ass doesn't fall into the wrong hands."
Fry says: "Why don't you just remove my tattoo?"
Nudar says: "Nice try."
Nudar says: "But you might have memorized it."
Fry says: "No I mighn't."
Fry says: "I can't even remember my mother's maiden name."
Nudar says: "It's Gleisner."
Nudar shoots at Fry who jumps out of the way, blowing up a statue behind him.
Fry says: "Stupid naked aliens."
Fry says: "Stupid Lars."
Fry says: "I hate the future."
Fry runs through the lounge where Amy is sleeping on the couch, laser blasts are flying over head. He backs up and picks up a hand mirror that is laying next to the TV.
Fry says: "Hmmmm!"
More laser shots. Fry whines and runs. Cut to locker room.
Bubblegum says: "Man, that cube root was a real buzzer beater, Clyde."
Fry bursts in, pants down, reading his butt with the mirror.
Fry says: "Zero."
Fry says: "One."
Fry says: "One."
Fry says: "One."
Fry says: "Zero."
Fry says: "Zero."
Fry says: "One."
Fry says: "One!"
The time sphere appears. The aliens burst in.
Schlump says: "Blast him."
Fry squeaks in fright and dives into the time sphere. The laser blast explodes a can of Torgo's Executive Powder.
Bender says: "Ha ha!"
Bender says: "You missed!"
Bender says: "Oh great master."
[Scene says: "Applied Cryogenics, January 1, 2000."
[Scene says: "12:30 AM."
Fry says: "Hello 2000."
Fry says: "I'm home."
Voice says: "Happy New Year, naked weirdo!"
Fry says: "Happy new year."
Fry pulls up his pants.
Nudar says: "Well, we'll never know where the ass guy went, and since we can't kill him, I say live and let live."
Bender says: "Aww, that's sweet boss."
Bender says: "Fry'll be nice and cozy back in the year 2000."
Nudar says: "What?!"
Nudar says: "!"
Nudar says: "How do you know he went to the year 2000?"
Bender says: "That's where he always goes."
Nudar says: "Hmm."
Nudar says: "Better play it safe."
Nudar says: "Go there a little earlier and wait for him."
Nudar says: "You know what to do."
Bender says: "You want me to concludify him, like some sort of dispatcherator?"
Nudar says: "Yes."
Nudar says: "And don't forget to terminate him."
Bender says: "Got it."
Bender says: "Preparing to terminate Philip Fry!"
Schlump says: "What's with the doofy sunglasses?"
Bender says: "It's really bright in the past."
[Scene says: "Applied Cryogenics, January 1, 2000."
[Scene says: "12:28 AM."
Bender says: "Ok, Fry."
Bender says: "Come ta poppa."
Bender says: "..."
Bender says: "Man I'm bored."
Bender says: "Ohhh!"
Bender drinks the 5 cans left in the 6 pack from SP3000.
Bender says: "Hey, there you are!"
Bender says: "..."
Bender says: "Oh, wait, that's Fry before he goes to the future."
Bender says: "I'm waiting for the one who comes back from the future."
Bender says: "Geesh this is confusing, and I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing."
Bender says: "Offf."
Bender says: "That cheap beer really goes right through you."
Bender says: "For the first time ever, I gotta use the bathroom, but if I leave, I might miss Fry."
Bender says: "Ohhhh unless..."
Bender says: "."
Bender-2 says: "..."
Bender-2 says: "and I bet it's gonna get a lot more confusing."
Bender-2 says: "Huh!"
Bender-2 says: "Ah!"
Bender-2 says: "Wha?"
Bender says: "Hi, I'm you from 19 seconds in the future."
Bender says: "Stay here and wait for Fry while I go to the bathroom."
Bender-2 says: "Ok Boss."
Bender-2 says: "After I kill Fry you're next."
Bender says: "What?"
Bender-2 says: "Nothing."
A Bender in a tux appears from the timesphere.
Bender-2 says: "What the?"
Bender-2 says: "Who are you?"
Bender-3 says: "I'm Bender from way at the end."
Bender-3 says: "I came back to put this rub-on time code on Fry's ass."
Bender-2 says: "So what are you now, a butler?"
Bender-2 says: "Spot of tea please, jerkwad!"
Bender-3 says: "It's called class, you yokel."
Bender-3 says: "Now if you'll excuse me, I have a buttocks to tattoo."
Bender-3 places the tattoo on Fry in the cryotube. Fry appears from the timesphere.
Fry says: "Hello 2000."
Fry says: "I'm home."
Voice says: "Happy New Year, naked weirdo!"
Fry says: "Happy new year."
Fry pulls up his pants. Bender-2 steps out, pointing the gun at Fry. Fry gasps.
Bender-2 says: "Hasta la vista, meatbag!"
Fry says: "Bender?"
Fry says: "What are you doing?"
Fry says: "It's me, your best friend."
Bender-2 says: "Must obey orders."
Bender-2 says: "Ohhhhh."
Bender-2 says: "Mustn't kill friend!!"
Bender-2 says: "Ohhhhhh!!!"
Bender-2 says: "Badly want to urinate!!!!!"
Fry says: "What's happening?"
Fry says: "Are you urinating?"
Bender-2 says: "Explosion in seven, six,..."
Fry kicks Bender-2 who stumbles back into a cryotube. Fry turns the control to 1,000,000 years.
Fry says: "It'll be a cold day in hell my friend."
Bender-2 says: "Hey, I'm supposed to be the one saying cool things!"
Bender-2 freezes in the tube.
[Scene says: "Fry waiting for elevator, the original Bender exits the restroom in time to see Fry get on the elevator."
Bender says: "Hey..."

Bender says: "Let us match wits."
Bender says: "..."
Bender says: "."
Bender says: "Ohhhh, how am I supposed to find him?"
Bender says: "All those times he blabbed on and on about his life in the twentieth century."
Bender says: "If only I'd paid the slightest bit of attention."
Bender says: "Oh well, guess I'd better go kill myself."
[Scene says: "exterior New York City, sounds of crowds partying."
[Scene says: "Pan to telephone booth, a fan man sitting on the curb in front of it."
[Scene says: "In side the booth, a drunk is on the phone."
Cryogenicist says: "Hello, bartender?"
Cryogenicist says: "I have thought it over, and far from being a fat pig, you are very nice and I would like another drink..."
Bender throws the cryogenicist out of the phone booth.
Bender says: "Take a barf buddy."
Bender says: "Ok suicide booth, give me your best shot."
Bender says: "Electrocution please, side order of poison."
Bender says: "Helloooo?"
Bender says: "Kill me you stupid machine."
Bender says: "..."
Bender says: "What the..."
Bender says: "local calls fifty cents?"
Bender says: "It's a street corner telephone parlor!"
Bender says: "Oh what kind of horrible suicide free time is this?"
Bender says: "Wait a minute, maybe this handy encyclopedia of humans will help me track Fry down."
Bender scans the Fry page in the telephone book.
Bender says: "One of these Frys must be Fry."
Bender says: "Look out Philip Fry, 'cause I got a little present for you."
Fat Man says: "My name is Phillip Fry."
Fat Man says: "Where's my present."
Bender says: "Hang on a second Fry."
Bender says: "I don't remember you being that ugly."
Fat Man says: "Oh no, I've always been this ugly."

Michelle says: "I kicked Fry out two hours ago."
Michelle says: "This is my new boyfriend..."
Michelle says: "uhhh..."
Constantine says: "Constantine."
Michelle says: "Really?"
Michelle says: "That's a dumb name."
Michelle says: "Ewwww."

Bender says: "Okay, you're still clean."
Bender says: "I mean metaphorically."
[Scene says: "Bender is walking down the street checking off names on page from the telephone book."
[Scene says: "He wads it up and tosses it in a dumpster."

Yancy Fry says: "Phil, some kind of trash can here to see you."
Jr. says: "Phil, some kind of trash can here to see you."
Yancy Fry says: "He's coming."
Jr. says: "He's coming."
Philip J. Fry II says: "Are you made of Tinkertoy?"
Bender says: "Hmmm."
Bender says: "It's been twelve years."
Bender says: "Maybe I'm getting taller."
Philip J. Fry II says: "You're not getting smarter."
Bender says: "Listen, pipsqueak, are you Philip J."
Bender says: "Fry or not?"
Bender says: "'Cause if you are, I'm here to kill you."
Philip J. Fry II says: "I'd like to see you try."
Bender pulls out the gun.
Philip J. Fry II says: "You---you--you want Uncle Phil."
Philip J. Fry II says: "He went to the North Pole on a fishyboat."
Bender says: "Ahhhh!"
Bender says: "The North Pole?"
Bender says: "I was just there."
[Scene says: "Riverfront, Brooklyn Bridge in the background."
Bender says: "One ticket to the North Pole, please, broom closet class."

Bender says: "Follow that guy."
Bender says: "There's an extra hundred in it for you if you follow him so close that you run him over."
Al Gore says: "Yes sir."
Taxi peels out, hits a garage truck, and looses control - careening through traffic and crashing through a sign reading "Warning - severely warped dock" as Bender and Gore scream. The taxi launches off the upturned end of the dock, drops back down, and rolls backwards into the garbage truck, launching Bender into the sky.
Al Gore says: "Dang."
Al Gore says: "That hundred dollars could have bought me one."
Al Gore says: "Gallon."
Al Gore says: "Of gas."
[Scene says: "Fry's cab pulls up in front of a decrepit Panucci's Pizza."

Bender says: "Ohhh!"
Bender says: "I lost him."
Bender says: "People will call me a failure."
Bender says: "Others however will call me the world's sexiest killing machine who's fun at parties."
Bender says: "Fry, old buddy, it's me, Bender."
Bender fires a blast into the window. The building explodes and collapses, the fire ball quick toasting Seymour, which explains how he was fossilized.
Bender says: "Wooo!"
Bender says: "I totally killed him."
Bender says: "Oh god, what have I done?"
[Scene says: "Exterior PE Building, 3007."

Bender says: "It's really bright in the past."
Bender recites time code and disappears into the time sphere. A second later he emerges from a trap door in the floor.
Bender says: "Mission accomplished."
Schlump says: "Fry is dead?"
Bender says: "No other robot could have done it."
Bender says: "It took twelve years of tireless stalking but I hunted down and killed my best friend."
Bender says: "I'm the greatest."
Fleb inserts the head cleaning cassette into Bender's mouth. His eyes revert to their normal appearance.
Head cleaner says: "Time code and obedience virus erased."
Bender says: "Huh?"

Bender says: "Hold still."
Farnsworth says: "Bender!"
Farnsworth says: "Stop killing for a minute."
Farnsworth says: "The Fry you murdered was doomed anyway."
Farnsworth says: "See?"
Fansworth switches on a holo projector in his belt buckle which shows the equations from his lab backboard.
Bender says: "What'd ya got there?"
Bender says: "Numbers?"
Farnsworth says: "When the time code duplicates a living thing, the copy is always doomed."
Farnsworth says: "And that includes flabby Jamaican potbellies."
Hermes says: "Kiss my front butt."
Fry says: "So my copy lives twelve years before Bender murdered him?"
Bender says: "Brutally murdered."
Fry says: "I wonder what his life was like?"
Scruffy says: "I guess we'll never know."
Zoidberg says: "Or will we?"

Fry says: "Thank god."
Fry says: "The present may stink, but at least now we can look forward to a better yesterday."
Fry-2 says: "I'm sorry Leela, I can't keep living in the past, by which I mean the future."

Dr. Schlovinowitz says: "That answers question number two."
Dr. Schlovinowitz says: "Question number three, do you know where the door is or would you prefer to be kicked out?"
Fry-2 says: "I don't know."
Fry-2 says: "I guess kicked out."
Leelu appears over the edge of the tank next to Fry-2.
Fry-2 says: "Hiya girl."
Fry-2 says: "My name's Fry, and I think you're a cutie 'cause I like things that have only one thing instead of two things."
Fry-2 picks a fish out of a bucked and feeds it to Leelu.
Dr. Schlovinowitz says: "Holy mackerel, she's eating whole mackerel."
Dr. Schlovinowitz says: "I don't know what your secret is but if you'll work for minimum wage you can start tomorrow."

Bender says: "We could sing."
Farnsworth says: "I'd rather kill myself."
Amy says: "Why not do both?"
Farnsworth says: "Oh, very well."
Farnsworth climbs onto a door step with effort.
I may as well jump.
Those sleazy naked scammers make me look like a chump.
Nudar says: "Neh!"
They robbed me of my dignity.
And most of my stuff.

Zoidberg says: "Oh, Yetis."
Farnsworth says: "Amy, you speak Yeti."
Farnsworth says: "What are they saying?"
Amy says: "I'm not sure, but it sounds like something to do with..."
Amy says: ""assaulting the interlopers."
Seconds later, Yetis burst open the wall. Everyone jumps, and Leela grabs a spear.
Leela says: "Don't mess with me, you ice-crapping snow-honkies."
Leela says: "I just got dumped."
Hermes says: "Sweet Yeti of the Serengeti, she's gone crazy eddie in the head-y."
Leela starts stabbing with the spear.

Fry-2 says: "Leave her alone."
Fry-2 says: "She just needs me to cheer her up."
Fry-2 says: "Wanna sword fight, girl?"
Leelu moans a no, then looks towards the sea, at an orange male narwhal doing flips and spins.

Santa says: "I'm too depressed for murder and mayhem."
Amy says: "Aw, try some antidepressants."
Amy says: "They're gummy."
Fry says: "What happened, Santa?"
Santa says: "The scammers cheated me out of my naughty list to use for telemarketing."

Leela says: "They've gone too far."
Leela says: "No more running and hiding."

Leela says: "What?"
Zapp says: "At ease, people."
Zapp says: "I was redecorating my undisclosed location when I received word of an heroic invasion."
Zapp says: "Kif, crouch down and shield my thighs from the cold, for God's sake."
Kif sighs and crouches down.
Zapp says: "We fight this battle, not for ourselves, but for our children and our children's children."
Zapp says: "Which is why I'm forming a children's brigade."
Zapp says: "Will the following youths please step forward?"

Kif says: "One."
Lars says: "Admiral, will we stop attacking at any point or is this one of those phony-baloney, feel-good wars like the war on drugs?"
Zapp says: "What's your name, smart mouth?"
Lars says: "Lars Fillmore."
Zapp says: "Ah, the lovely Leela's on-again, off-again paramour."
Zapp says: "Perhaps a suicide mission would knockthe insubordination out of you."
Leela says: "Yes, yes, yes."
Kif says: "We're approaching Earth, sir."

Hermes says: "Professor, can you wire my head directly into the battle grid?"
Farnsworth says: "I can wire anything directly into anything."
Farnsworth says: "I'm the professor!"
Hermes says: "Then prepare to see a bureaucrat's brain in action."
[Scene says: "Farnsworth finishes hooking up Hermes' jar to the main battle grid."

A viewscreen comes down from the ship.
Nudar says: "Nice attack, doo-doo heads!"
Nudar says: "Too bad we have one last trick up our sleeve!"
Amy says: "I doubt that!"
Nudar says: "Remember this, Farnsworth?"
Nudar pulls out the satchel containing the Spheroboom.
Farnsworth says: "Farnsworth?"
Farnsworth says: "That's me!"
Farnsworth says: "My doomsday device!"
Farnsworth says: "So it was the scammers!"
Farnsworth says: "They sawed off my hand and stole the doomsday device."
Bender says: "lt wasn't them."
Bender says: "lt was me, Bender."
Bender says: "The master criminal!"
Nudar says: "So what'll it be?"
Nudar says: "- Unconditional surrender?"
Leela says: "Never!"
Nudar says: "Or totaI destruction?"
Leela says: "Also never!"
Nudar says: "You have 30 seconds."
Nudar says: "Make up your minds!"
Leela says: "Nevvveeeeer!"
Bender says: "People, I'm sorry."
Bender says: "You've never before heard me say those words, or even the individual letters that make them up."
Bender says: "But I am."
Bender says: "And with a huge amount of modesty, I humbly beg your forgiveness."
The crew gasp.
Bender says: "Shut up and keep looking apologized to."
Leela says: "Dum de dum."
Leela presses the "FIRE" button. The Spheroboom launches from a torpedo tube towards the scammer's ship'.
Nudar says: "Uh-oh."
Nudar says: "I have a worrisome shriveling sensation in my sprunjer."
Nudar opens up the case to find the rose and the note "You've been scammed, sweetheart!" from before. The nudist aliens scream as the Spheroboom breaks the glass on their ship then explodes.
Amy says: "Yay!"
Amy says: "Bender!"
Fry says: "All right!"
Crew cheers.
Fry says: "Bender, how the Hulk did you end up with the doomsday device?"
Bender chuckles.
Bender says: "I was working the long con all along."
Bender says: "While sawing off the professor's hand with an extremely dull saw, I had some time to think."
Bender says: "So I asked myself, "Who could use a doomsday device more?"
Bender says: "The scammers or me, Bender?"
Bender says: ""."
Bender says: "After several minutes of sawing, I knew the answer."
Bender says: "Me, Bender."
Bender says: "So I retrieved the dummy satchel..."
Bender says: "..."
Bender says: "and as soon as I was out of the scammers' control, I pulled the old switcheroo."
Flashback of Bender putting the fake case in the safe and stealing the real one.
[Scene says: "Bender stands on a podium and speaks to everyone."
[Scene says: "Happy 3008 banners are strung above people sitting at tables."
Bender says: "And that's how I saved Earth and am the greatest!"
Everyone cheers.
Nixon says: "Bender the robot, I'm proud to present you Earth's highest award for swindling."
Nixon says: "The Dirty Double-Cross."
Bender says: "I'll aways treasure it and immediately hock it."
Lars says: "There, your body's good as new."
Lars says: "Just pop in an executive suppository every few..."
Lars sees Leela nearby and walks off.
Leela tries to hold back tears.
Fry says: "What is it?"
Leela says: "Nothing."
Fry says: "It's supposed to be a celebration, Leela."
Fry says: "I mean, come on."
Fry says: "Whimmy-wham-wham-whazle!"
Leela says: "I can't help it."
Leela says: "I was gonna be married."
Leela says: "I was so happy."
Fry says: "Well, maybe you'll meet someone else someday."
Leela says: "No, you don't understand."
Leela says: "Lars is the only man I'll ever love."
Leela says: "I know it in my heart."
Fry says: "You remember when we first met?"
Leela says: "Uh-huh."
Leela says: "lt was right there in the cryogenic lab, eight years ago today."
Fry says: "Meet me there in five minutes."
Fry says: "It's important."
Fry-2 says: "Why are you so sad, Leelu?"
The orange narwhal is still following them, flipping and spinning.
Fry-2 says: "Him again?"
Fry-2 says: "Wait a second, are you two..."
Leelu nods.
Fry-2 takes the plunger off his head.
Fry-2 says: "Atanarjuat, Fufu, come here!"
Fry-2 says: "We have to set Leelu free."
Inuit #2 says: "Dang."
Inuit #2 says: "I never should have quit my job at the casino."
Fry-2 says: "Me, neither."
Fry-2 says: "But she needs what'll make her happy, not what'll make me happy."
The Inuits open the top part of the cage, Leelu swims around and jumps out into the open sea, then crosses teeth with the orange narwhal as Fry-2 looks on sadly.
Fry-2 says: "Goodbye, Leelu."
Fry-2 sobs.
Fade in to Leela looking out the Applied Cyrogenics building. Fry and Lars walk in.
Lars says: "I don't much know about frozen heads, but, of course, if it's Mahatma Gandhi, I'll..."
Lars says: "Leela?"
Leela says: "Lars?"
Lars says: "I..."
Lars says: "I really have to go, I..."
Leela says: "Fry, was this an idiotic trick to get Lars and me back together?"
Fry says: "Quite idiotic."
Fry says: "But you don't need to be an idiot to see that you two belong together."
Fry says: "And, Leela,I want what'll make you happy, not what'll make me happy."
Lars says: "I'm sorry, I really am, but Leela and I just can't be married."
Fry says: "Why not?"
Fry says: "You obviously love each other."
Fry says: "What are you, cousins?"
Lars says: "Fry, you deserve to know the truth."
Lars says: "It's because..."
Nudar walks in the doorway, holding a laser.
Nudar says: "Nobody move!"
Leela says: "Nudar!"
Leela says: "How did you survive the doom blast?"
Nudar says: "My doom-proof platinum vest absorbed most of the radiation."
Nudar says: "In retrospect, I wish I'd been wearing doom-proof pants, but you know us nudists."
Nudar says: "Now give me the time code!"
Fry says: "I don't have it!"
Fry says: "Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt."
Nudar says: "Not you."
Nudar points his gun at Lars.
Nudar says: "You!"
Leela says: "Lars?"
Leela says: "He doesn't have it."
Leela says: "He never had it."
Leela says: "Fry had it!"
Fry says: "But Nibbler heat-blasted it off my butt!"
Fry says: "I want to stress that part!"
Nudar says: "My throbbing sprunjer says otherwise."
Nudar says: "Now where is it?"
Lars says: "I'm not afraid of you or your expensive gun!"
Lars says: "Go ahead and shoot!"
Nudar says: "Oh, yeah?"
Nudar says: "Then what if I kill the woman you love?"
Leela says: "Don't you understand, numb-neck?"
Leela says: "He doesn't love me!"
Lars says: "I've..."
Lars says: "always loved you."
Lars says: "Don't hurt her."
Lars says: "I'll give you the code."
Lars walks over to the cryogenic tube with the Bender-2. Lars opens the tube and tackles Bender-2 and Nudar to the ground. Leela and Fry run and hide behind a desk.
Nudar says: "What the..."
Bender-2 says: "Woah!"
Bender-2 explodes. The smoke clears to reveal Lars and Nudars' bodies and parts of Bender-2.
Leela says: "Lars, no!"
The smoke clears some more, revealing a rip in Lars' pants and the time code tattoo on his behind. Leela gasps and looks at Fry.
[Scene says: "Fade to 2012, Fry-2 is shaking hands with Captain Leroy."
[Scene says: "Fry-2 leaves the ship observed by Bender, and gets out of a Taxi in from of a decrepit Panucci's Pizza building."
[Scene says: "He pets Seymour and enters the building."
[Scene says: "A moment later Bender crashes down in the street."
Fry-2 says: "It's enough just to know you're happy."
Fry-2 says: "You, too."
Fry-2 says: "It's enough to know you're happy with Lars."
Bender says: "Fry, old buddy!"
Bender says: "It's me!"
Bender says: "Bender!"
Fry-2 says: "My hair!"
Coughs.
Fry-2 says: "My larynx!"
Fry-2 with his hair and parts of his beard burned off stands up and sees his reflection in the mirror next to the picture of Lars and Leela. He is Lars.
Lars says: "I'm Lars?"
Lars says: "I'm Lars!"
Lars bursts a side door of the burning building at a run.
Fry says: "Wait for me, Leela!"
Fry says: "I'll be there in a thousand years."
[Scene says: "The building explodes behind him."
[Scene says: "Lars enters the darkened Applied Cryogenics facility to the tune of "30 Century Man"."
[Scene says: "He opens Michelle's tube, which is set for 254 years."
[Scene says: "He climbs above her, breaking off a chunk of her hair and resets the tube for 990 years."
[Scene says: "Fade to the timer reaching zero and dinging."
[Scene says: "Exterior of the Head Museum, 3002."
[Scene says: "Cut to a sign that says “Help Wanted: Experienced Feeder”."
[Scene says: "Dr."
[Scene says: "Cahill removes sign."
[Scene says: "Cut to Lars, with Dr."
[Scene says: "Cahill in the background, shaking hands with Charles de Gaulle's head."
[Scene says: "Close up of Lar's head."
[Scene says: "Fade to exterior Orbiting Meadows with a banner reading “Farwell Lars”."
Lars says: "So I got a job at the Head Museum and waited for the wonderful day when Leela would arrive."
Lars says: "Everything was perfect until Hermes exploded at our wedding."
Lars says: "That's when I learned that, as a time paradox duplicate, I, too, was doomed."
Lars says: "I couldn't put Leela through that."
Lars says: "So I called it off."
Lars says: "I'm sorry, Leela."
Leela says: "I understand."
Crazy Guy says: "That concludes another Silly Willy Wideo Will!"
Fry says: "He was a good man, Leela."
Leela says: "Yeah..."
Leela says: "you were."
Leela kisses Fry on the cheek as Fry smiles.
Farnsworth says: "Well, I guess that wraps everything up in a nice, paradox-free bow."
Bubblegum says: "Not quite, my wrinkly brother."
Nibbler says: "Right on!"
Nibbler says: "In order for any of this to make any sense at all, someone must make one final trip back in time to put the code on Fry's ass in the first place!"
Bender says: "Sounds like a job for me, Bender."
Benders tears the tattoo off Lars and reads it.
Bender says: "Zero, zero, one, one, zero, zero..."
[Scene says: "PE hanger bay."
Bender says: "Mission accomplished!"
Fry says: "You put the time code on my ass?"
Bender says: "Someone's ass."
Bender says: "Oh, and guess what?"
Bender says: "I met all these really cool guys with treasure down in the limestone cavern, so I invited them to stick around instead of coming up when they were logically supposed to."
Benders start emerging from the trap door all carrying historical treasures, eventually filling the hanger with hundreds if not thousands of Benders.
Nibbler says: "No!"
Nibbler says: "No!"
Nibbler says: "Everyone out of the universe!"
Nibbler says: "Quick!"
Nibbler eats himself and disappears.
Bender says: "What's the worst that can happen?"
There is a rumbling and Benders start exploding. A crack opens in the universe.
Bender says: "Well, we're boned."
