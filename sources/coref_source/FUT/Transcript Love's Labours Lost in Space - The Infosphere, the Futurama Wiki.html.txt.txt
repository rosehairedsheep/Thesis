[Scene says: "Restaurant."
[Scene says: "Leela sits at a table with a date, a man called Doug."
(00 says: "03) ⨂Leela: This place was a great choice."
(00 says: "The food is amazing."
(00 says: "And such generous portions."
(00 says: "08) ⨂Doug: You like the meal just wait until you try these after-dinner mints."
(00 says: "10) ⨂Leela: You know, Doug, most guys are put off by my eye."
(00 says: "It's nice to finally meet someone who's open-minded."
(00 says: "Ew!"
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Kitchen."
[Scene says: "Amy, Leela and Fry stand around drinking coffee."
(00 says: "49) ⨂Fry: What was wrong with your date last night?"
(00 says: "51) ⨂Leela: I don't know."
(00 says: "Something I couldn't quite put my finger on."
(00 says: "Possibly his vile lizard tongue."
(00 says: "57) ⨂Amy: You're too picky."
(00 says: "58) ⨂Fry: Yeah."
(00 says: "If you rule out every guy with a lizard tongue or a low I."
(00 says: "Q."
(00 says: "or an explosive violent temper, of course you're gonna be lonely."
(01 says: "05) ⨂Leela: There's nothing wrong with having high standards."
[Cut to says: "Planet Express: Meeting Room."
[Cut to says: "Amy, Fry and Leela walk in."
[Cut to says: "The others are sitting around the table."
(01 says: "08) ⨂Zoidberg: The female Leela's problem is purely medical."
(01 says: "Soon she will drop her eggs and they will hatch and all will be well."
Amy, Leela and Fry sit down.
(01 says: "15) ⨂Amy: You just have to give guys a chance."
(01 says: "Sometimes you meet a guy and think he's a pig, but then later you realise he actually has a really good body."
(01 says: "22) ⨂Leela: Thank you all for the inspiring advice, but I'm perfectly happy with my life the way it is."
(01 says: "27) ⨂Bender: That sounds like a cry for help."
(01 says: "29) ⨂Amy: Let's all take her out tonight."
(01 says: "There's lots of great places to meet people."
(01 says: "33) ⨂Hermes: The Federal Sex Bureau."
(01 says: "34) ⨂Bender: A saucy puppet show."
(01 says: "36) ⨂Zoidberg: The rotting carcass of a whale."
(01 says: "38) ⨂Amy: Hmm, I'll pick!"
[Scene says: "The Hip Joint."
[Scene says: "A nightclub on {{|Jetsons}}-esque stilts with hovering platforms and strobe lighting."
[Scene says: "Everyone except Fry is wearing outfits with grooby rings."
(01 says: "46) ⨂Amy: Oh, wow!"
(01 says: "It's totally retro!"
(01 says: "50) ⨂Fry: Why's everyone wearing those rings?"
(01 says: "52) ⨂Amy: Guh!"
(01 says: "Because nobody wears them anymore!"
(01 says: "Rings are stupid!"
(01 says: "55) ⨂Fry: I think they look cool."
(01 says: "57) ⨂Amy: Sh!"
(01 says: "Don't let anyone hear you say that!"
(01 says: "59) ⨂Man: Hey, did that guy just say rings are cool?"
(02 says: "01) ⨂Amy: Nope, he said they're stupid."
The man thumbs-ups.
(02 says: "03) ⨂Man: Cool!"
Time Lapse. Leela, Amy and Bender sit at a table with drinks.
(02 says: "06) ⨂Amy: So what do you think of that guy by the bar?"
(02 says: "08) ⨂Leela: I don't know."
(02 says: "Maybe?"
(02 says: "09) ⨂Bender: Forget it, he's gay."
(02 says: "11) ⨂Leela: What?"
(02 says: "How can you tell?"
(02 says: "13) ⨂Bender: I just know these things."
(02 says: "I've got what they call gaydar."
(02 says: "16) ⨂Leela: There's no such thing."
(02 says: "18) ⨂Bender: No?"
(02 says: "Yep!"
(02 says: "He's gay!"
(02 says: "27) ⨂Amy: Are you sure?"
(02 says: "28) ⨂Bender: Definitely."
(02 says: "Unless I'm getting interference from a gay weather balloon."
Fry talks to a woman at the bar.
(02 says: "33) ⨂21st-century girl: You're from the 20th century?"
(02 says: "That's incredible!"
(02 says: "I'm from the 21st century."
(02 says: "38) ⨂Fry: No way!"
(02 says: "We've got so much in common."
(02 says: "40) ⨂21st-century girl: We sure do."
(02 says: "Remember when those cyborgs enslaved humanity?"
(02 says: "44) ⨂Fry: Uh, yeah!"
(02 says: "That rings a bell."
Back at the table, a well-built man has joined the others.
(02 says: "47) ⨂Amy: This is Bolt Rolands."
(02 says: "Bolt is a hyper-sled racer with 10 wins on the pro-circuit."
(02 says: "53) ⨂Bolt: Hello, beautiful!"
(02 says: "55) ⨂Bender:  I think she means 10 wins on the gay circuit."
Bolt chuckles.
(02 says: "58) ⨂Bolt: I wish!"
(02 says: "Those cats can really fly."
Zoidberg sits alone at the bar. He tries to pick up a drink but his claws just knock the glass over. He folds his arms and sulks. A lobster in a tank catches his eye and he stares and smiles, lovestruck. At the table, a green cloud hovers where Bolt was.
(03 says: "17) ⨂Amy: This is M5438, an entity of pure energy."
(03 says: "21) ⨂Leela: That's great, really, but he's just not what I'm looking for."
(03 says: "25) ⨂M-5438: I understand."
(03 says: "One day you will evolve beyond your physical body, and on that day I hope you will pick up the phone."
He flies away. Amy sighs.
(03 says: "33) ⨂Amy: You're impossible."
Bender's gaydar beeps.
(03 says: "36) ⨂Bender: Just as well; I think he comes from a dimension that's big on musical theatre."
[Scene says: "Outside The Hip Joint."
[Scene says: "Everyone is leaving: Amy with M-5438, Zoidberg with the lobster and Fry with the 21st century girl."
[Scene says: "Bender is already outside."
(03 says: "48) ⨂Fry: Pst."
(03 says: "I need the apartment tonight."
(03 says: "Go see a saucy puppet show."
He hands Bender some cash.
(03 says: "52) ⨂Bender: Can do!"
[Scene says: "The Hip Joint."
[Scene says: "Leela is the only person left in the room."
[Scene says: "A janitor passes by her table, sweeping."
(03 says: "56) ⨂The Hip Joint janitor: My, my, my!"
(03 says: "What's a beautiful lady like you—"
(03 says: "Oh, my!"
(03 says: "Eurgh!"
(03 says: "I'm sorry, I thought you had two eyes."
He runs off.
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Meeting Room."
[Scene says: "It's the next morning and everyone sits around the table drinking coffee."
(04 says: "04) ⨂Bender: So, Leela, you must have had your pick of the litter last night at closing time."
(04 says: "09) ⨂Leela: Could you guys please stop talking about my personal life?"
(04 says: "12) ⨂Farnsworth: Yes, let's all talk about Leela's personal life later."
(04 says: "But right now we have business to attend to."
(04 says: "18) ⨂Fry: A delivery?"
(04 says: "19) ⨂Farnsworth: No."
(04 says: "A tax-deductible mission of charity."
He flicks a switch, the lights dim and a translucent holographic image of a planet is projected over the table.
(04 says: "23) ⨂Computer Voice: This is Vergon 6."
(04 says: "25) ⨂Farnsworth: This is Vergon 6."
(04 says: "27) ⨂Amy:  Buh!"
(04 says: "28) ⨂Farnsworth: It's a sunny little doomed planet, inhabited by a number of frisky little doomed animals."
(04 says: "33) ⨂Leela: Animals?"
(04 says: "34) ⨂Farnsworth: That's right."
(04 says: "Animals in desperate need of rescue."
(04 says: "You see, Vergon 6 was once filled with a super-dense substance known as dark matter, each pound of which weighs over ten thousand  pounds."
Holographic dark matter fill the planet.
(04 says: "47) ⨂Leela: Wait!"
(04 says: "What about the animals?"
(04 says: "49) ⨂Farnsworth: Well, dark matter is extremely valuable as starship fuel."
(04 says: "That's why it was all mined out, leaving the planet completely hollow."
The holographic dark matter dwindles to nothing.
(04 says: "57) ⨂Leela: Yes, but what about the animals?"
(05 says: "00) ⨂Farnsworth: The wha?"
(05 says: "01) ⨂Leela: The animals."
(05 says: "02) ⨂Farnsworth: I didn't say anything about animals."
(05 says: "Now it seems that the planet will collapse within three days."
(05 says: "Incidentally, this will kill all the animals."
(05 says: "09) ⨂Leela: So we have to bring back two of each kind."
(05 says: "Just like Noah's Ark."
(05 says: "13) ⨂Bender: Why two?"
(05 says: "Oh!"
He giggles.
[Scene says: "Ships Cockpit."
[Scene says: "The ship is en route to the planet."
[Scene says: "Bender and Fry sit on opposite sides of the cocpit."
[Scene says: "They lean across to talk."
(05 says: "21) ⨂Fry: I bet you Leela's holding out for a nice guy with one eye."
(05 says: "24) ⨂Bender: That'll take forever."
(05 says: "What she oughta do is find a nice guy with two eyes, then poke one out."
(05 says: "29) ⨂Fry: Yeah, that'd be a timesaver."
Leela is sat right behind them.
(05 says: "31) ⨂Leela: Do you mind?"
(05 says: "33) ⨂Bender: Here you go."
(05 says: "You can use this as an eye-poker."
(05 says: "35) ⨂Leela: Thank you."
(05 says: "But I don't care how many eyes a man has..."
(05 says: "as long as it's less than five."
(05 says: "All I'm looking for is a guy who's adventurous, self-confident..."
[Cut to says: "Space."
[Cut to says: "The ship flies on."
(05 says: "44) ⨂Leela:..."
(05 says: "maybe a snappy dresser."
As the ship flies away, a large ship, the Nimbus, flies over the top.
[Cut to says: "Nimbus Bridge."
[Cut to says: "The captain, Zapp Brannigan, stands admiring himself while his first officer Kif sits to his left."
[Cut to says: "They both wear red uniforms."
[Cut to says: "Kif is a spindly little green alien and Zapp's physique is dominated by a large, poorly-contained gut."
(05 says: "47) ⨂Zapp: These new uniforms are pretty snappy, eh, first officer?"
(05 says: "49) ⨂Kif: I suppose, Captain."
(05 says: "I'm not as big a fan of velour as you are."
(05 says: "Now what do you want to do about that unidentified ship?"
The Planet Express ship flies across the viewscreen.
(05 says: "56) ⨂Zapp: Destroy them!"
(05 says: "Mmm!"
(05 says: "That's got a nice feel to it."
Time Lapse.
(06 says: "05) ⨂Zapp: Captain's journal: Star date, 3000."
(06 says: "3."
(06 says: "08) ⨂Kif: Who are you talking to, sir?"
(06 says: "10) ⨂Zapp: You!"
(06 says: "Aren't you getting this?"
(06 says: "We have detected a vessel attempting to break the security cordon around Vergon 6."
(06 says: "I'm anticipating an all-out tactical dogfight, followed by a light dinner..."
(06 says: "ravioli, ham, sundae bar."
[Cut to says: "Ships Cockpit."
[Cut to says: "The crew see the Nimbus through the windscreen."
(06 says: "28) ⨂Leela: Hey, look!"
(06 says: "That's Zapp Brannigan's ship."
(06 says: "30) ⨂Fry: Wow!"
(06 says: "The Zapp Brannigan?"
(06 says: "33) ⨂Leela: Uh-huh!"
(06 says: "34) ⨂Fry: Who's the Zapp Brannigan?"
[Cut to says: "Nimbus Bridge."
[Cut to says: "Zapp and Kif watch the ship approach."
(06 says: "36) ⨂Kif: Shall I fire on them now, sir?"
(06 says: "38) ⨂Zapp: Not yet, Kif."
(06 says: "In the game of chess, you can never let your adversary see your pieces."
(06 says: "What?"
[Cut to says: "Ships Cockpit."
(06 says: "45) ⨂Leela: They say Zapp Brannigan single-handedly saved the Octillian System from a horde of rampaging Killbots."
(06 says: "51) ⨂Fry: Wow!"
(06 says: "52) ⨂Bender: A grim day for robot-kind."
(06 says: "Ah, but we can always build more Killbots!"
(06 says: "57) ⨂Leela: He's the most decorated captain in the whole Democratic Order of Planets."
(07 says: "01) ⨂Fry:  Leela's got a boyfriend!"
(07 says: "03) ⨂Leela: No I don't."
(07 says: "But I think we ought to meet with him and see if he'll help us rescue those animals."
(07 says: "07) ⨂Bender: Well, just in case you guys hit it off, you'll wanna take this with you."
[Cut to says: "Nimbus Bridge."
(07 says: "14) ⨂Kif: Sir, they're headed straight for us."
(07 says: "16) ⨂Zapp: A well-calculated move straight out of Sun Tzu's classic text The Art Of War, or my own masterwork: Zapp Brannigan's Big Book of War."
(07 says: "28) ⨂Kif: Sir, they've docked with us and have come aboard."
(07 says: "30) ⨂Zapp: Then I have risked all and lost."
(07 says: "Kif, old man, I'll be in the escape pod."
(07 says: "If that wicker chair I like survives the slaughter, have it sent to my P."
(07 says: "O."
(07 says: "box."
The door opens and the Planet Express crew walk in. Zapp screams and hides behind a chair. Leela looks around and sees  Kif.
(07 says: "42) ⨂Leela: Hello, I'm Leela, captain of the Planet Express delivery ship."
(07 says: "We've come aboard to plead for your assistance."
Zapp jumps in front of Kif.
(07 says: "50) ⨂Zapp: I'm in command here."
(07 says: "Zapp Brannigan."
(07 says: "Has my fame preceded me or was I too quick for you?"
(07 says: "55) ⨂Leela: Oh, not at all."
(07 says: "I'm just so, uh, really thrilled to meet you!"
(08 says: "00) ⨂Zapp: You're an impressive piece of captain."
(08 says: "Beautiful and deadly -- a potent combination."
(08 says: "05) ⨂Leela:  You don't mean that!"
(08 says: "07) ⨂Zapp: But I do."
(08 says: "I doubt I've seen more than three or four captains sexier than you, and only one who was deadlier."
He takes her hand and Fry leans in.
(08 says: "13) ⨂Fry: I heard that one time you single-handedly defeated a horde of rampaging somethings in the something-something-system."
(08 says: "19) ⨂Zapp: The Killbots?"
(08 says: "A trifle!"
(08 says: "It was simply a matter of outsmarting them."
(08 says: "23) ⨂Fry: Wow!"
(08 says: "I never would have thought of that!"
(08 says: "25) ⨂Zapp: You see, Killbots have a preset kill limit."
(08 says: "Knowing their weakness, I sent wave after wave of my own men at them, until they reached their limit and shutdown."
(08 says: "Kif, show them the medal I won."
[Scene says: "Nimbus Mess Hall."
[Scene says: "Leela, Zapp, Fry and Bender sit at a table, looking down at the rest of the crew who are eating."
[Scene says: "Kif grates cheese over Zapp's food."
(08 says: "39) ⨂Zapp: More, please."
(08 says: "A little more..."
(08 says: "more..."
(08 says: "keep going."
He carries on.
(08 says: "45) ⨂Leela: Captain Brannigan, we really need to talk to you about our mission."
(08 says: "47) ⨂Zapp: Whatever it is, I'm willing to put wave after wave of men at your disposal."
(08 says: "Right, men?"
He raises his glass to the crew.
(08 says: "53) ⨂Crewman:  You suck!"
(08 says: "54) ⨂Leela: We're hoping to save the animals of Vergon 6 from extinction."
Zapp spits out his drink.
(08 says: "58) ⨂Zapp: Vergon 6?"
(08 says: "This light dinner is over."
(09 says: "01) ⨂Leela: Wait!"
(09 says: "What's wrong?"
(09 says: "02) ⨂Zapp: The Democratic Order of Planets prohibits interfering with undeveloped worlds."
(09 says: "It's a little rule known as "Brannigan's Law"."
(09 says: "09) ⨂Leela: But people already interfered."
(09 says: "That planet was mined completely hollow."
(09 says: "14) ⨂Zapp: Yes, by a Democratic Order of Planets mining crew."
(09 says: "17) ⨂Leela: This doesn't make any sense."
(09 says: "19) ⨂Zapp: I don't pretend to understand Brannigan's Law."
(09 says: "I merely enforce it."
(09 says: "23) ⨂Leela: Fine!"
(09 says: "We'll save the animals without your help."
(09 says: "26) ⨂Zapp: I'm afraid I can't allow that."
(09 says: "Guards!"
Guards grab Leela, Fry and Bender.
(09 says: "30) ⨂Fry: What just happened?"
(09 says: "31) ⨂Bender: He's throwing us in prison."
Fry sighs.
(09 says: "33) ⨂Fry: Dang!"
(09 says: "Can I get this wrapped up?"
He holds up his plate and Zapp nods.
[Scene says: "Nimbus Brig."
[Scene says: "Leela touches the force field around the doorway and gets electrocuted."
(09 says: "39) ⨂Leela: Ow!"
(09 says: "I might've liked Zapp Brannigan if he weren't a pompous dimwit who threw me in prison."
(09 says: "45) ⨂Bender: You really are too picky."
[Scene says: "Nimbus Corridor."
(09 says: "46) ⨂Zapp: Kif, follow me up to the observation deck."
(09 says: "I've got some musing to do."
Zapp climbs a ladder and Kif accidentally looks up his skirt.
(09 says: "53) ⨂Kif: Oh, jeez!"
[Scene says: "Nimbus Observation Deck."
[Scene says: "Zapp looks out through the dome window."
(09 says: "56) ⨂Zapp: I'm facing a formidable female adversary, Kif."
(09 says: "Suggestions?"
(10 says: "00) ⨂Kif: I fail to see any problem, sir."
(10 says: "You already imprisoned her under directive B-10."
(10 says: "8-1."
(10 says: "06) ⨂Zapp: You mean Brannigan's Law?"
(10 says: "08) ⨂Kif: Right, that law."
(10 says: "10) ⨂Zapp: Which one?"
Kif sighs.
(10 says: "12) ⨂Kif: Brannigan's Law."
(10 says: "13) ⨂Zapp: Kif, you're my best and most loyal friend but you've earned my contempt once again."
(10 says: "As my protégé you should know that the only way to deal with a female adversary is to seduce her."
(10 says: "This time we are sure she's a woman, right?"
(10 says: "27) ⨂Kif: Yes."
(10 says: "28) ⨂Zapp: Good!"
(10 says: "Invite her to my quarters."
(10 says: "Oh, and have the boy lay out my formal shorts."
(10 says: "34) ⨂Kif: "The boy", sir?"
(10 says: "35) ⨂Zapp: You."
(10 says: "You lay out my formal shorts."
He disappears down the ladder.
[Scene says: "Nimbus Corridor."
[Scene says: "Kif walks past crewmembers with Leela following him."
(10 says: "39) ⨂Kif: The jackass wants to see you in his quarters."
(10 says: "42) ⨂Leela: Good."
(10 says: "This will be my chance to reason with him, captain to captain."
(10 says: "46) ⨂Kif: And he wants you to wear this."
Kif holds up a skimpy little outfit. Leela ignores it and knocks on Zapp's door.
(10 says: "51) ⨂Zapp:  Come and get it!"
[Cut to says: "Zapp's Quarters."
[Cut to says: "The doors open and Leela walks in."
[Cut to says: "The room is filled with candles and red furnishings."
[Cut to says: "Zapp lies on his hovering heart-shaped bed under a huge portrait of himself that is similar to Aaron Shikler's official portrait of JFK."
(10 says: "55) ⨂Zapp: Welcome to my humble chamber, or as I call it, "the Lovenasium"."
(10 says: "Sham-pag-in?"
(11 says: "02) ⨂Leela: I didn't realise you were such a coin-a-sewer."
(11 says: "05) ⨂Zapp: Well I have studied abroad."
(11 says: "Or two!"
He laughs. Leela fakes a laugh and throws her champagne on the floor while Zapp isn't looking.
(11 says: "12) ⨂Zapp: Uh-huh?"
(11 says: "15) ⨂Zapp: Uh-huh?"
(11 says: "16) ⨂Leela: I'd like you to reconsider letting us rescue those animals."
(11 says: "18) ⨂Zapp: Mm-hm."
(11 says: "erotic."
(11 says: "31) ⨂Leela: What?"
(11 says: "32) ⨂Zapp:  Erotic!"
[Cut to says: "Kif's Quarters."
[Cut to says: "Zapp's words echo around the ship."
[Cut to says: "Kif gets frustrated and bangs the ceiling with a broom handle."
[Scene says: "Nimbus Brig."
[Scene says: "Fry and Bender are still inside."
(11 says: "39) ⨂Fry: We can definitely escape, Bender."
(11 says: "All you have to do is bend the hatch off this steam pipe."
(11 says: "43) ⨂Bender: Hey, yeah!"
He bends the hatch off and the steam rushes out of it and starts filling the room.
(11 says: "49) ⨂Fry: No good!"
(11 says: "It's full of steam!"
[Scene says: "Zapp's Quarters."
[Scene says: "Leela impatiently paces back and forth."
(11 says: "52) ⨂Zapp: You look like a woman who enjoys the finer things."
(11 says: "Come over here and feel my velour bedspread."
(11 says: "58) ⨂Leela: I'm not really in the mood."
(12 says: "00) ⨂Zapp: Leela, it's real velour."
(12 says: "Just let yourself go."
He rolls over onto his back.
(12 says: "05) ⨂Leela: Can I please just go back to prison?"
(12 says: "07) ⨂Zapp: You'd rather sit in prison than spend one evening with the Zapper?"
(12 says: "11) ⨂Leela: Much rather!"
(12 says: "What are you doing?"
(12 says: "18) ⨂Zapp:  Oh, God, I'm pathetic."
(12 says: "Sorry."
(12 says: "Just go."
(12 says: "You want the rest of the sham-pag-in?"
(12 says: "26) ⨂Leela: No."
(12 says: "And it's pronounced "sham-pane"."
(12 says: "29) ⨂Zapp:  Oh, God, no!"
(12 says: "32) ⨂Leela: It's not a big deal."
(12 says: "34) ⨂Zapp:  I get so lonely."
(12 says: "I just thought you, a fellow captain, would understand."
(12 says: "39) ⨂Leela: Oh, forget it."
(12 says: "40) ⨂Zapp:  Yeah, it's great ordering people around and stuff but through it all you're completely alone."
(12 says: "45) ⨂Leela: It comes with the job."
(12 says: "48) ⨂Zapp:  I'm just so lonely!"
He cries more.
(12 says: "52) ⨂Leela: Oh, come on."
(12 says: "Cheer up."
(12 says: "It's not that bad."
[Scene says: "Nimbus Brig."
[Scene says: "The room is still full of steam."
(12 says: "57) ⨂Fry: You wanna try escaping again?"
(12 says: "59) ⨂Bender: Nah, I'm comfy."
They are wearing towels enjoying the steam room they've created.
(13 says: "01) ⨂Fry: Man, Leela's been gone a long time."
(13 says: "I hope she's at least making progress with Zapp Brannigan."
[Cut to says: "Zapp's Quarters."
[Cut to says: "The morning after the night before..."
[Cut to says: "Leela wakes up."
[Cut to says: "She turns her head and sees she's lying in Zapp's bed."
[Cut to says: "With him."
[Cut to says: "He is still asleep and has a big grin on his face."
[Cut to says: "She screams."
Time Lapse. Leela has dressed and is sneaking out. Zapp wakes up.
(13 says: "17) ⨂Zapp: Good morning, lover."
(13 says: "19) ⨂Leela: Uh, listen, Zapp."
(13 says: "21) ⨂Zapp: Now you're officially my woman."
(13 says: "Kudos!"
(13 says: "I can't say I don't envy you."
(13 says: "25) ⨂Leela: Zapp, last night was a mistake."
(13 says: "27) ⨂Zapp: A sexy mistake."
(13 says: "29) ⨂Leela: No, just a regular mistake."
(13 says: "For a split second my common sense was overwhelmed by pity."
Zapp laughs.
(13 says: "35) ⨂Zapp: A split second is all it takes."
(13 says: "That's why sooner or later you'll come crawling back to the Zapper."
(13 says: "42) ⨂Leela: The only kind of crawling I'm doing to you is away..."
(13 says: "from!"
(13 says: "46) ⨂Zapp: Leela, you're obviously confused and aroused."
(13 says: "49) ⨂Leela: Look, I'm going down to Vergon 6 to save those animals whether you like it or not."
(13 says: "54) ⨂Zapp: Go ahead."
(13 says: "I won't stop you."
(13 says: "55) ⨂Leela: Threaten all you-- Wait."
(13 says: "What?"
(13 says: "57) ⨂Zapp: We both know you won't make it halfway to Vergon 6 before the craving sets in."
(13 says: "Then you'll come crawling back for another taste of sweet, sweet candy..."
(13 says: "bam!"
He points at his crotch.
(14 says: "09) ⨂Leela: Eurgh!"
She storms out. Zapp chuckles.
(14 says: "13) ⨂Zapp:  Kif!"
Kif appears in the doorway.
(14 says: "15) ⨂Kif: Yes--  Yes, Captain?"
(14 says: "18) ⨂Zapp: I have made it with a woman."
(14 says: "Inform the men."
[Scene says: "Nimbus Brig."
[Scene says: "Kif lets Fry and Bender out of the cell."
(14 says: "24) ⨂Kif: The fatso says you're free to go."
(14 says: "26) ⨂Fry: Really?"
(14 says: "Why?"
(14 says: "28) ⨂Kif:  "Why" indeed."
He looks at Leela then walks off.
(14 says: "30) ⨂Fry: What does that mean?"
(14 says: "31) ⨂Leela:  Nothing."
(14 says: "32) ⨂Bender: So should we get our stuff and head down to the planet?"
(14 says: "35) ⨂Leela:  We just talked, OK?!"
(14 says: "!"
[Scene says: "The ship flies down to Vergon 6, through the green cloudy sky."
[Scene says: "The planet is surreal and Dali-like."
[Scene says: "Vergon 6 Surface."
[Scene says: "Leela, Fry and Bender stand beside the ship with large nets."
(14 says: "46) ⨂Leela: Alright, we don't have much time to collect these animals."
(14 says: "The planet is supposed to collapse in approximately two hours ago."
[Montage says: "The crew hunt for the animals."
[Montage says: "First, Bender tries to find the purple fruit snake but it finds him first and eats him."
[Montage says: "He stands up inside the snake and drags it back to the ship."
[Montage says: "Fry tries to get the windy shrimp but it blows him away."
[Montage says: "Leela tries to get the four-legged mimic which looks like a horse but copies people's heads and movements."
[Montage says: "Fry holds a net and tries to decide which one is the mimic."
[Montage says: "Leela points at the mimic and it points back at her."
[Montage says: "Fry looks..."
[Montage says: "and throws the net over Leela."
[Montage says: "Later, Leela ticks off the final animal on the checklist."
Time Lapse. The checklist is filled. A small animal comes out from behind some plants. It is mostly black, has one huge nostril in the middle of it's face and a three eyes, one of them on a long stalk coming out of the middle of it's head.
(15 says: "24) ⨂Leela: Hello, there."
(15 says: "Hmm."
(15 says: "He doesn't seem to be on the checklist."
(15 says: "34) ⨂Bender: So, you're saying we can cook him?"
(15 says: "36) ⨂Fry: Yeah, a barbecue!"
(15 says: "I'll wear my hilarious apron."
(15 says: "38) ⨂Leela: No!"
(15 says: "I don't care how hilarious your apron is, we're not cooking him."
(15 says: "Aww!"
(15 says: "I'll call him Nibbler."
(15 says: "47) ⨂Bender: Aww!"
(15 says: "I'll fire up the grill!"
Time Lapse.
(15 says: "51) ⨂Leela: I hope he'll be OK in there with all those big animals."
[Scene says: "Ships Cargo Bay."
[Scene says: "Leela opens the outer door, puts him in and closes it."
[Scene says: "The other animals surround Nibbler."
[Scene says: "He sniffs at them and then eats one whole."
[Scene says: "Nimbus Observation Deck."
[Scene says: "Zapp looks at Leela through a telescope."
(16 says: "12) ⨂Zapp: Y'know, Kif, once my woman returns I won't have much time to hang out with the boys anymore."
(16 says: "17) ⨂Kif: That's a shame, sir."
(16 says: "19) ⨂Zapp: So let's make the most of our time together, shall we?"
(16 says: "Never mind."
(16 says: "Just give me a back rub."
[Scene says: "Vergon 6 Surface."
[Scene says: "Bender carries a two-headed flamingo."
(16 says: "27) ⨂Bender: I found a pair of hermaphlamingos."
(16 says: "29) ⨂Leela: Good."
(16 says: "That's the last species."
[Scene says: "Ships Cargo Bay."
[Scene says: "The crew look inside and gasp in horror."
[Scene says: "Nibbler sits in the empty room."
(16 says: "33) ⨂Bender: Hey."
(16 says: "What the--?"
(16 says: "34) ⨂Fry: Where'd they all go?"
Nibbler eats the Hermaphlamingos, making lots of disgusting noises. The crew watch and cringe.
(16 says: "43) ⨂Leela: Nibbler!"
(16 says: "44) ⨂Fry: I can't believe we flew halfway across the galaxy and enjoyed a steam just to get lunch for that stupid animal!"
(16 says: "50) ⨂Bender: He's pending for a bending."
He rolls up his sleeves and chases Nibbler. He runs to Leela and she picks him up.
(16 says: "54) ⨂Leela: Leave him alone."
(16 says: "It's not his fault that he's an unstoppable killing machine."
(16 says: "Is it, snoogums?"
The ground shakes, rocking the ship.
(17 says: "01) ⨂Fry: The planet's kerploding!"
[Cut to says: "Vergon 6 Surface."
[Cut to says: "Fry runs out through a door and falls through the ground."
[Cut to says: "Bender reaches into the hole and pulls him back up."
[Cut to says: "Ships Cockpit."
(17 says: "09) ⨂Leela: Prepare for lift-off."
(17 says: "We're out of fuel."
(17 says: "Bender, I told you to fill the tank before we left."
(17 says: "17) ⨂Bender: Yeah, I'll do it when we get back."
The ground shakes again.
(17 says: "21) ⨂Fry: Man, lucky for us Zapp Brannigan's nearby."
(17 says: "24) ⨂Leela: No way!"
(17 says: "Forget it!"
(17 says: "I refuse to go crawling back to him!"
(17 says: "27) ⨂Fry: What?"
(17 says: "What are you talking about?"
(17 says: "29) ⨂Leela:  Nothing."
(17 says: "We just talked."
(17 says: "31) ⨂Bender: So what's your problem?"
(17 says: "It's not like you slept with him."
(17 says: "Oh, my God!"
(17 says: "42) ⨂Fry: How could you, Leela?"
(17 says: "I thought you had some standards."
(17 says: "I mean, jeez, he's a dumb, gross gorilla!"
(17 says: "47) ⨂Leela: That's enough!"
(17 says: "Don't you think I feel bad enough already?"
(17 says: "51) ⨂Fry: No!"
The ground shakes violently.
(17 says: "53) ⨂Leela: Alright, alright."
(17 says: "I'll call him."
(17 says: "I mean, if living is that important to you."
[Scene says: "Nimbus Bridge."
(17 says: "59) ⨂Zapp: And that's why you'll never make captain, Kif."
(17 says: "Hmm."
Leela face appears.
(18 says: "04) ⨂Leela:  Hello, Zapp?"
(18 says: "05) ⨂Zapp: Well, well, well!"
[Cut to says: "Ships Cockpit."
(18 says: "08) ⨂Leela: Zapp, we're out of fuel..."
[Cut to says: "Nimbus Bridge."
(18 says: "10) ⨂Leela:..."
(18 says: "and Vergon 6 is about to implode."
(18 says: "We need your help."
(18 says: "12) ⨂Zapp: So, crawling back to the Big Z like a bird on its belly."
(18 says: "Delicious."
(18 says: "18) ⨂Leela:  Bird's don't crawl."
(18 says: "19) ⨂Zapp: They've been known to."
[Cut to says: "Ships Cockpit."
(18 says: "21) ⨂Leela: Look, are you going to rescue us or not?"
(18 says: "23) ⨂Zapp:  Can't you ask a little more..."
(18 says: "sexfully?"
Fry and Bender make encouraging gestures at Leela.
(18 says: "29) ⨂Leela:  Please?"
[Cut to says: "Nimbus Bridge."
(18 says: "30) ⨂Leela:  Big Z?"
(18 says: "32) ⨂Zapp: Certainly."
(18 says: "But first you'll have to get rid of that thing."
(18 says: "That's the law, Leela."
(18 says: "And Brannigan's Law is like Brannigan's love: Hard and fast!"
[Cut to says: "Ships Cockpit."
(18 says: "42) ⨂Zapp:  Now put that greasy rat outside and we'll tow you to safety."
(18 says: "45) ⨂Leela: I would never abandon a helpless animal."
(18 says: "Y'know, Zapp, once I thought you were a big, pompous buffoon."
(18 says: "Then I realised that inside you were just a pitiful child."
(18 says: "But now I realise that outside that child is a big, pompous buffoon!"
(18 says: "59) ⨂Zapp:  And which one rocked your world?"
Leela growls and slams down the receiver and his face fizzles off the screen.
(19 says: "03) ⨂Fry: Wow!"
(19 says: "Way to tell that guy off."
(19 says: "Now what's your secret escape plan?"
(19 says: "07) ⨂Leela: Uh, I guess to sit here and wait for death."
(19 says: "10) ⨂Bender: Can do!"
He puts his feet up and reclines in his chair. There is a huge bang and the ship jerks backwards.
(19 says: "13) ⨂Bender: What the hell was that?"
[Scene says: "Ships Cargo Bay."
[Scene says: "There is a big, round, black blob in Nibbler's litter tray."
(19 says: "18) ⨂Fry: Pew!"
He fans the air in front of his nose.
(19 says: "20) ⨂Leela: I don't believe it!"
(19 says: "It's dark matter."
(19 says: "22) ⨂Bender: So this guy just unloaded a steaming pile of starship fuel?"
(19 says: "26) ⨂Leela: His species must've filled the entire planet with it."
(19 says: "Did you do that, you cute little--  Come on."
(19 says: "That should be more than enough fuel to get us outta here."
(19 says: "Bender, pick it up and put it in the engine."
Bender mutters to himself and drags the dark matter across the floor towards the engine room.
[Cut to says: "Ships Engine Room."
[Cut to says: "Bender throws the dark matter into the furnace."
[Cut to says: "Ships Cockpit."
[Cut to says: "The fuel gauge fills up, Leela throttles forward and the ship lifts off, moments before the ground collapses."
[Cut to says: "They fly away from the planet and it explodes."
[Cut to says: "The crew cheer."
(20 says: "04) ⨂Leela: We made it!"
(20 says: "And some of the animals survived."
She looks through the binoculars and sees some animals standing on a tiny fragment of rock.
(20 says: "09) ⨂Bender: So a couple of animals didn't die and Leela got lucky."
(20 says: "That's what I call a successful mission!"
(20 says: "15) ⨂Fry: We're heroes!"
[Scene says: "Leela's Quarters."
[Scene says: "Leela writes in her diary."
[Scene says: "Nibbler lies on her lap and she strokes him."
(20 says: "18) ⨂Leela:  Dear Captain's Diary: I may not have found love on this mission but I did find a cute little companion who excretes starship fuel."
(20 says: "And that's just as good."
She pauses for a moment then tears the page out, screws it up and throws it in the bin.
[Scene says: "Outside Nimbus."
(20 says: "32) ⨂Zapp:  Captain's journal: Star date..."
(20 says: "uh."
Kif sighs.
(20 says: "35) ⨂Kif:  April 13th."
(20 says: "37) ⨂Zapp:  April 13th..."
(20 says: "point two."
[Cut to says: "Nimbus Bridge."
(20 says: "40) ⨂Zapp: We have failed to uphold Brannigan's Law."
(20 says: "However, I did make it with a hot alien babe."
(20 says: "And in the end is that not what man has dreamt of since first he looked up at the stars?"
(20 says: "Kif, I'm asking you a question!"
Kif sighs.
