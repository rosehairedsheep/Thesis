Mr. Wong says: "Big, empty planet!"

Mrs. Wong says: "Make yourselves at home."
Zoidberg stands on the landing, dressed in a bathrobe. He is holding a green bottle.
Zoidberg says: "Don't mind if I already did."
Zoidberg says: "By the way, do you have anymore of this Dom Perignon bubble bath?"
Zoidberg says: "There was only enough to fill the tub halfway."
Mr. and Mrs. Wong growl.
[Scene says: "Wong Ranch."
[Scene says: "The Wongs and the staff pass a field where a man rolls out fully-grown corn."
Farnsworth says: "This is quite a large ranch you have."
Mr. Wong says: "17."
Mr. Wong says: "9 billion acres."
Mr. Wong says: "We own entire western hemisphere."
Mr. Wong says: "That the best hemisphere!"
Farnsworth says: "It's the same on Earth."
They all look over a fence at a herd of buggalo.
Mr. Wong says: "Here is most number one product of all: The mighty buggalo."
Mr. Wong says: "They used for everything; meat, milk and their shells make good row boat."
He points to Zoidberg, rowing a buggalo shell on a lake.
Zoidberg says: "I broke your television."
Hermes says: "Mon, it must take forever to brand all those cattle."
Mr. Wong says: "Not really."
Mr. Wong says: "We own so much stuff it easier just to brand everything that not ours."
He brands Hermes' briefcase with a "Not Property Of Wongs" brand.
Hermes says: "Please don't do that."
Amy leaps over a fence to another buggalo. It is surrounded with cushy things and has a ribbon around it's neck.
Amy says: "Betsy!"
Amy says: "This is my sweet, little Betsy."
Amy says: "I raised her from a larva that ate one of my sweaters."
Mr. Wong says: "Yes, everybody love Betsy."
Mr. Wong says: "We going to eat her at Amy's wedding."
Mr. Wong says: "If she ever get married!"

Amy says: "Gleesh!"
Amy says: "Please don't say things like that when you meet my boyfriend tonight."
Mr. Wong says: "Oh, that right."
Mr. Wong says: "We finally get to spend some time with this Mr."
Mr. Wong says: "Kif."
Mrs. Wong says: "I just hope he's a nice man who can make us lot of grandchildren."
Mrs. Wong says: "This not some parallel universe where you getting any younger."
[Scene says: "Nimbus Bridge."
[Scene says: "The Nimbus orbits Mars."
[Scene says: "Zapp and Kif talk."
[Scene says: "Near them is a photo of Amy."
Zapp says: "Now remember, Kif, the quickest way to a girl's bed is through her parents."
Zapp says: "Have sex with them and you're in."
Kif says: "Actually, sir, I'm-I'm a little nervous about meeting her family."
Zapp says: "Well that's natural."
Zapp says: "After all you're meek and uninteresting."
Zapp says: "Until now you've gotten by on my left-over charisma, scrounging off it like a tiny charisma parasite."
Kif says: "I just hope they like me."
Zapp says: "And why wouldn't they?"
Zapp says: "Yes, yes, I know."
Zapp says: "Tiny, meek, uninteresting."
Zapp says: "Spare me your tedious life story, Kif."
Zapp says: "And above all have fun!"
[Scene says: "Outside The Wongs' House."
[Scene says: "Lots of people have gathered at the ranch for country music and barbecued buggalo on Mars Day."
[Scene says: "The DJ scratches some country music."
Bender says: "Yeah, yeah, get on down!"
Bender says: "Oh, yeah!"
Bender says: "Drop another barnyard bomb on us, Vanilla Corn!"
DJ says: "Yo, fool, it's Mixmaster Festus!"
Mr. Wong puts more buggalo meat on the barbecue. A Pepto-Bismol tanker pulls up next to a BBQ Sauce tanker and unloads. Fry sets his plate of buggalo down on a barrel and pumps Pepto-Bismol onto it. He picks it up and walks over to the barbecue.
Fry says: "So what's Mars Day about, anyway?"
Mrs. Wong says: "It commemorate the day centuries ago when our ancestor, Sir Reginald Wong, bought Mars from stupid natives."
Leela says: "How can you call the Native Martians "stupid"?"
Mr. Wong says: "They sell whole planet for one bead."
Mr. Wong says: "Sound stupid to me!"
He, Mrs. Wong and Fry laugh.
Farnsworth says: "That is stupid!"
Leela says: "I can't believe you're laughing at the tragic exploitation of a proud, bead-loving people."
Fry says: "Lighten up, Leela."
Fry says: "It's funny!"
Leela says: "Of course it is."
Leela says: "But you don't have to laugh!"
Amy and Kif stand by the buffet. Amy kisses him and he is startled.
Kif says: "Amy, no!"
Kif says: "Not on your parents' planet!"
RJ says: "Howdy, Amy."
RJ says: "Glad to see you've come back to the country."
RJ says: "It's where the flavour is."
Amy hugs him.
Amy says: "RJ, this is my boyfriend, Kif."
RJ says: "This wimp?"
RJ says: "You've gone a long way, baby."
RJ says: "Cigarette, partner?"
RJ puts one in Kif's mouth and he coughs.
RJ says: "I haven't even lit it yet!"
He lights it.
Kif says: "Oh."
Kif says: "Is it lit now?"
RJ says: "Yep."
RJ says: "You're pathetic!"
Zoidberg walks over to the barbecue.
Zoidberg says: "Host-man!"
Zoidberg says: "Host-woman!"
Zoidberg says: "I'm having a wonderful time!"
Mr. Wong says: "You here five hours and already you tear up couch, draw moustache on priceless painting and fill pool with brine shrimp."
Zoidberg says: "By the way, I took the liberty of fertilising your caviar."
Mr. Wong looks at his food and chews slower. At the bar, Bender pours himself another drink, knocks it back, stacks the glass on top of 13 others, pours the last of the bottle down his neck and stacks the bottle on top of 11 others. He belches fire. Kif stammers and Amy wipes sweat from his face.
Amy says: "Just relax."
Amy says: "I'm sure my parents will love you."
Kif says: "You don't understand."
Kif says: "When I get nervous, I can't control my camouflage reflex."
Kif says: "Oh, goodness!"
Kif says: "Oh, odds and bodkins!"
Fry refills at the barbecue.
Fry says: "I'll have a thorax and some feelers."
Mr. Wong says: "You want some salad with that?"
Fry says: "Yuck!"
Amy and Kif arrive.
Amy says: "Mom?"
Amy says: "Dad?"
Amy says: "You remember Kif?"
Mr. Wong says: "This your boyfriend?"
Mr. Wong says: "I have instant dislike of him!"
Mrs. Wong says: "He too scrawny to father grandchildren."
Amy says: "He's not scrawny, he's just small-boned."
Kif says: "Actually, I don't have bones."
Mr. Wong says: "Yes, yes!"
Mr. Wong says: "You a big squishy wuss!"
Mr. Wong says: "Amy should be dating real man."
Mr. Wong says: "Like him!"
He points to RJ over by a campfire.
Kif says: "I can be manly too."
Kif says: "I think I'll, uh, light up a smoke."
He takes out a cigarette and lights it.
Amy says: "Wrong way!"
Kif drags.
Kif says: "Smooth!"
He chokes, turns pale and collapses.
[Scene says: "Wong Ranch."
[Scene says: "Kif and Amy lean over a fence and watch the grazing cattle."
Amy says: "Look on the bright side: My parents left after you passed out so they didn't even see you barf."
Kif says: "Oh, now they'll never think I'm manly enough to date their daughter."
He sobs.
Amy says: "It's OK, Kif."
Amy says: "I'll go get you a tissue from your tote."
She walks off. RJ puts his hand on her shoulder and stops her.
RJ says: "Hey there, Amy."
RJ says: "Like you to meet my buddy, Joe."
Enter Joe Camel.
Joe says: "Sorry I'm late."
Joe says: "My pool game ran long at the jazz club!"
RJ laughs.
RJ says: "Kids love him!"
Kif watches Amy laugh and growls.
[Cut to says: "Outside The Wongs' House."
[Cut to says: "A loud noise that sounds like a very long "omm" comes into earshot."
Fry says: "What's that weird sound?"
The noise gets louder. Wind blows down the "Happy Mars Day" banner.
Mr. Wong says: "Dust storm!"
Mr. Wong says: "Oh, dust storm!"
Mr. Wong says: "Everybody into house."
Mr. Wong says: "Hurry, before we die."
Mr. Wong says: "And wipe your damn feet!"
[Scene says: "The Wongs' Lounge."
[Scene says: "Everyone is inside."
[Scene says: "Mrs."
[Scene says: "Wong looks out of the window."
Mrs. Wong says: "Phew!"
Mrs. Wong says: "Everyone OK?"
Mrs. Wong says: "No one considering lawsuit?"
Farnsworth says: "Hmm."
Farnsworth says: "I might have mental anguish."
Mr. Wong says: "I'll have you know I'm friends with every judge on planet."
Farnsworth says: "I'm OK then."
Mrs. Wong says: "Storm dying down."
Mrs. Wong says: "Leo, check if buggalo herd is OK."
[Cut to says: "The Wongs' Porch."
[Cut to says: "Mr."
[Cut to says: "Wong opens the door and looks across at the cattle."
[Cut to says: "A tornado sweeps across the ranch, taking the buggalo with it."
[Cut to says: "Everyone gasps."
Mr. Wong says: "Oh!"
[Cut to says: "The Wongs' Lounge."
Leela says: "What happened to the buggalo?"
Mrs. Wong comes running.
Mr. Wong says: "They been rustled under cover of storm."
Mr. Wong says: "We ruined!"
Zoidberg puts his arms around Mr. and Mrs. Wong and they struggle.
Zoidberg says: "Nooo!"
They push him away.
Amy says: "Don't worry, Daddy."
Amy says: "It'll be OK."
Mr. Wong says: "Oh, really?"
Mr. Wong says: "Who gonna save us?"
Mr. Wong says: "Drunken garbage can?"
Kif says: "Lieutenant Kif Kroker!"
Hermes says: "Alright then."
He sits down and munches some crisps.
Time Lapse. The other guests have left.
Mr. Wong says: "Aye-ah!"
Mr. Wong says: "Those buggalo are what made Wong family so rich and powerful."
Mr. Wong says: "Oh, Inez, with them stolen, we ruined!"
Mrs. Wong says: "OK."
Mrs. Wong says: "I want a divorce."
Zoidberg is dressed golf clothes.
Zoidberg says: "Mom!"
Zoidberg says: "Dad!"
Zoidberg says: "Don't ask me to choose!"
Amy says: "They're not your parents, I'm not your sister and that's not your golf cart."
Zoidberg says: "Aw!"
He reverses the golf cart away.
Amy says: "Everybody just calm down."
Amy says: "Kif promised he'd catch the rustlers."
Enter Kif in cowboy gear.
Kif says: "Mrs."
Kif says: "Wong, do you have a neckerchief I could borrow?"
Time Lapse.
Kif says: "My plan is to take all the remaining buggalo and lead them on a rough, tough cattle drive."
Kif says: "Then, when the rustlers attack, I'll make a citizen's arrest!"
Farnsworth says: "It sounds dangerous."
Farnsworth says: "Someone could get killed."
Farnsworth says: "Fry, Leela, Bender, I want you to go with him."
Fry says: "Aw, man!"
Leela sighs. Bender mocks Farnsworth.
Kif says: "Don't worry, Mr."
Kif says: "and Mrs."
Kif says: "Wong."
Kif says: "I'll get your cattle back or die trying."
Mr. Wong says: "Hey, we can't lose!"
Amy says: "No, Kif!"
Amy says: "It's too risky."
Amy says: "You don't have to do this to prove your manliness."
Mrs. Wong says: "Oh, yes he does!"
[Scene says: "Wong Ranch."
[Scene says: "RJ leads some creatures towards Kif."
RJ says: "Here are your mounts!"
Leela rubs one of the creatures and it makes a squelching noise.
Leela says: "She's got a fine coat."
Kif says: "Now, we need buggalo to lure the rustlers."
Kif says: "How many are left?"
Amy says: "You're lookin' at her."
Amy says: "Betsy's the only one left."
Amy says: "She was curled up in my hamper when the storm hit."
Amy says: "Aw, she likes you!"
Kif says: "Saddle up, men."
Kif says: "We got some no good rustlers to..."
Kif says: "catch!"
[Scene says: "Mars Surface."
[Scene says: "Kif, Leela and Fry ride ahead while Bender sits on a wagon playing a banjo and singing a Bonanza-like tune."
Somebody wants to pick a fight with us,.
He'd better bite my ass!
Fry says: "Yee-haw!"
Leela says: "Wow, look at that: Olympus Mons, the tallest volcano in the solar system."
Fry says: "Where?"
Leela says: "Right in front of you."
Fry says: "Oh."
Fry says: "Oh!"
Kif says: "We'll camp near the top."
Kif says: "The rustlers will be sure to spot us there."
Fry says: "Where?"
[Scene says: "Olympus Mons."
[Scene says: "The party have set up camp for the night."
[Scene says: "Bender tells a ghost story around the campfire."
Bender says: "And even though the computer was off and unplugged, an image stayed on the screen."
Bender says: "It was..."
Bender says: "the Windows logo!"
Fry says: "Pft, that's not scary!"
Bender says: "It is if you're a laser printer."
Leela says: "OK, my turn to tell a ghost story."
Fry says: "Hook on the hand!"
Kif says: "OK, I've got one."
Fry says: "Man in the attic!"
Leela says: "Fine, Mr."
Leela says: "Know-It-All-About-Something-Finally, you tell a story!"
Fry says: "With pleasure."
Bender says: "Sorry, go on."
Time Lapse. Someone peers through the bushes.
Fry says: "And then, while they sat helplessly around the campfire..."
Amy says: "Surprise!"
Fry, Bender, Kif and Leela scream. Amy comes out of the bushes.
Kif says: "Amy?"
Kif says: "What are you doing here?"
Amy says: "I forgot to give you something before you left."
Kif says: "What?"
Amy kisses him and his camouflage kicks in.
Amy says: "Is that your camouflage reflex or are you just happy to see me?"
Time Lapse. Amy and Kif lie at the top of the mountain, looking at the stars.
Kif says: "I love it out here, Amy."
Kif says: "I feel so manly."
Kif says: "I have a blister, I-I spit!"
Kif says: "A-And of course, I tell no one my feelings."
Amy says: "But you still have them, right?"
Kif says: "Oh, yes."
Kif says: "But I keep them inside until I can write them in my diary."
Amy says: "Ah, it's a wonderful night."
Kif says: "It sure is."
Kif says: "I could just lie here beside you staring at the sky all night."
Amy says: "I can't!"
Amy says: "What's that?"
Kif says: "Maybe we just made love."
Amy and Kif look over the rim of the volcano and into the crater.
Amy says: "The buggalo!"
Amy says: "They're in the crater."
Kif says: "The rustlers must have seen me coming and run off, scared."
Amy says: "Oh, Kif!"
Amy says: "You're so brave!"
Kif says: "Sh!"
Kif says: "They'll hear us!"
Time Lapse. It is daytime. Kif pulls a wire from a mineshaft on the side of the volcano.
Kif says: "OK, the dynamite's in place."
Amy says: "Are you sure there's no other way to get the buggalo out?"
Leela says: "Not unless your parents have thousands of helicopters at their disposal."
Bender says: "Too late!"
Bender says: "This is more fun!"
He detonates the dynamite and the buggalo are blown out of the crater. They roll down the side of the volcano.
Amy says: "Kif!"
Amy says: "You did it!"
Amy says: "But how did you know the dynamite would work?"
Kif says: "I once took a seminar in ejecting chickens from a sand dune."
Kif says: "The principle is essentially the same."
The noise returns.
Fry says: "Hey, it's that "barbecue's over" sound again."
Dust flies up and the tornado blows towards them.
Leela says: "We're in the eye of the storm!"
Fry says: "Where?"
Bender says: "What's that?"
There is a buzzing noise. Three Martians come through the tornado, riding flying buggalo. They have blue-grey skin and the tops of their heads look like Native American headgear has been fused to their head. Amy screams.
Fry says: "My God!"
Leela says: "Who are they?"
The lead Martian, Singing Wind, raises his hand.
Singing Wind says: "Fehk!"
Singing Wind says: "We are the Native Martians."
Everyone except Fry gasps. After a late reaction, he also gasps.
Fry says: "Also, I didn't know buggalo could fly."
Singing Wind says: "Only those who revere Mother Mars can fly buggalo."
Singing Wind says: "And only they shall have buggalo."
Singing Wind says: "And they're us."
Kif says: "But your, um, Martian-ness, these buggalo aren't yours."
Kif says: "They belong to the Wong family."
Singing Wind says: "You mean family that took all Martian land and gave us one lousy bead?"
Amy says: "Uh-huh!"
Amy says: "Amy Wong."
Amy says: "And you are?"
Singing Wind says: "Mad at Wong family!"
Singing Wind says: "We plan to ruin them by stealing buggalo."
Singing Wind says: "But now we take girl instead."
Two other Martians pick up Amy and they fly away.
Amy says: "Wait!"
Amy says: "I'm too rich to be kidnapped!"
The Martians fly away.
Kif says: "Amy!"
Kif says: "Nooo!"
He cries.
Bender says: "Don't worry, Kif."
Bender says: "I'm sure some other beautiful, rich girl will fall in love with you."
Bender laughs and Kif cries.
[Scene says: "Wong Ranch."
[Scene says: "The buggalo are returned and Kif closes the gate behind them."
Mr. Wong says: "Hooray!"
Mr. Wong says: "You bring back cattle."
Kif says: "Yes..."
Kif says: "but..."
Kif says: "I'm afraid I've got some bad news as well."
Mrs. Wong says: "Let Amy tell us."
Mrs. Wong says: "That way it soften the blow."
Mrs. Wong says: "Why Amy being so quiet?"
Kif says: "Um..."
Kif says: "well, um..."
Kif says: "that is, um..."
A smaller tornado whips by and drops a piece of paper in front of Mr. Wong. He picks up.
Mr. Wong says: "Oh, no!"
Mr. Wong says: "Martians kidnap Amy!"
Mr. Wong says: "I know it them 'cause they no use good grammar."
Kif says: "I'll get your daughter back, sir."
Kif says: "I swear."
Mr. Wong says: "Forget it, squishy."
Mr. Wong says: "You the one lose her in first place."
Mr. Wong says: "You done enough."
Mrs. Wong says: "Yeah."
Mrs. Wong says: "This time we get most decorated law man in the whole universe!"
Kif says: "You mean-- Oh, no, please."
Kif says: "I beg you!"
[Scene says: "The Wongs' Lounge."
[Scene says: "The law man has arrived."
Zapp says: "I am the man with no name."
Zapp says: "Zapp Brannigan, at your service!"
Kif sighs.
Mrs. Wong says: "Please, Mr."
Mrs. Wong says: "Brannigan, we need you go get our daughter back."
Zapp says: "Very well."
Zapp says: "I'll clean up Kif's mess."
Zapp says: "I shall go bargain with the Martian's personally."
Zapp says: "Your gasps intrigue me."
Zapp says: "Explain."
Mr. Wong says: "Martians have no land."
Mr. Wong says: "They been gently encouraged to live on reservation deep underground."
Mr. Wong says: "No one ever dare go there."
Farnsworth says: "This mission is incredibly dangerous."
Farnsworth says: "Someone's sure to be killed."
Bender says: "Damn you, old man!"
[Scene says: "Mars Surface."
[Scene says: "Zapp, Kif, Leela, Fry and Bender trek across the desert again."
[Scene says: "Betsy catches up with them and rubs against Kif."
Leela says: "Aw, look."
Leela says: "Betsy followed you, Kif!"
Zapp says: "I didn't realise you were bringing your girlfriend, lieutenant!"
He sniggers and Kif sighs.
Kif says: "She won't leave me alone."
Zapp says: "Did I say "girlfriend"?"
Zapp says: "She sounds more like a wife!"
There is silence. A tumbleweed blows by.
Time Lapse. They reach a cliff and look over the edge.
Zapp says: "Behold: The Great Stone Face of Mars."
Fry says: "Hm."
Zapp says: "The only known entrance to the Martian reservation."
Leela says: "What about the Great Stone Ass of Mars?"
Zapp says: "Well, yeah, but it's way over the other side of the planet."
Time Lapse. They prepare to walk through one of the nostrils.
Zapp says: "Nose-ward, ho!"
[Cut to says: "Martian Reservation."
[Cut to says: "The nose begins to get darker."
[Cut to says: "They mumble."
[Cut to says: "They are surrounded by torches."
[Cut to says: "They gasp."
[Cut to says: "It gets lighter and they see they are surrounded by Martians with bows and laser-arrows."
[Cut to says: "Singing Wind walks in."
Singing Wind says: "Fehk!"
Singing Wind says: "I am Singing Wind, chief of the Martian tribe."
Zapp says: "Take me to your leader."
The Martians stare blankly at him.
Singing Wind says: "Moving along."
Singing Wind says: "Why you trespass on our land?"
Zapp says: "We come to negotiate the release of Amy Wong."
Zapp says: "And just to clarify: Land is the stuff that has sky over it."
He drinks from a Slurm can and throws it down. A Martian cries à la the Native American in those American public service advertisements.
Leela says: "They have such respect for the planet."
Martian #1 says: "Cynthia used to drink Slurm."
Singing Wind claps and Martians come in holding Amy.
Singing Wind says: "We will give back girl when we get back planet surface."
Zapp says: "How do we even know she's alive?"
Amy says: "I'm fine."
Zapp says: "Sh!"
Zapp says: "You're weakening our bargaining position."
Zapp says: "How about instead you give us the girl and we carve a bunch of our presidents into your sacred mountain?"
Singing Wind says: "You waste words."
Singing Wind says: "We want return of land that was taken from us."
Bender says: "Uh, actually you traded it for a bead."
Singing Wind says: "Tribe suffer heap big buyer's remorse."
Singing Wind says: "We want land back!"
Zapp says: "Chief, my people are a people of law."
Zapp says: "And that law is..."
Zapp says: "..."
Zapp says: "no backsies!"
Singing Wind says: "The time for stupid statements is over!"
He and the other Martians make the "omm" noise. The dust picks up.
Zapp says: "Oh, boy!"
[Cut to says: "Mars Surface."
[Cut to says: "The mouth of the Great Stone Face's opens and the tornado blows the sand away, revealing a Great Stone Body."
[Cut to says: "Martian Reservation."
[Cut to says: "Dust blows in Leela's face."
Leela says: "Ow, ow, ow, ow!"
Leela says: "My eye!"
She puts in some eye drops.
[Scene says: "Mars University Campus."
[Scene says: "The tornado blows down the "Knowledge Brings Fear" sign and strips away the Martian statue to a skeleton."
[Scene says: "Outside The Wongs' House."
[Scene says: "Zoidberg looks out the window."
Zoidberg says: "Ma!"
Zoidberg says: "Pa!"
Zoidberg says: "Our precious ranch!"
Mrs. Wong beats Zoidberg over the head with a trophy head.
[Scene says: "Martian Reservation."
[Scene says: "Singing Wind gives a signal and the tornado sucks up Amy."
Kif says: "Amy, no!"
Kif says: "It's too windy!"
Kif says: "Stay calm, dearest!"
Kif says: "I'll save you!"
He flies Betsy into the tornado.
Amy says: "Kif!"
Amy says: "You're flying Betsy!"
Kif says: "Need a lift?"
Amy grabs hold of his face and stretches it.
Singing Wind says: "Great Mother Mars!"
Singing Wind says: "He has the gift!"
He gives a signal and the Martians stop making the noise and the tornado dies away. Kif lands Betsy. Zapp, Leela, Fry and Bender cheer.
Leela says: "Yay, Kif!"
Zapp says: "Kroker, that was one Brannigan-esque feat of heroism!"
Singing Wind says: "We have misjudged you, green one."
Singing Wind says: "You fly the buggalo like us."
Singing Wind says: "You have true reverence for Mother Mars."
Singing Wind says: "Let there be peace between us."
Martian #2 says: "Yes."
Martian #2 says: "Let us smoke-em peace pipe."
Kif says: "Smoke-em?"
[Scene says: "Martian Tent."
[Scene says: "Singing Wind smokes the pipe and passes it to Kif."
Singing Wind says: "Here, take."
Kif says: "Ooh, no thanks."
Kif says: "I'm on the peace patch."
Singing Wind says: "You must smoke peace pipe, and you must do it peacefully."
Singing Wind says: "Or we'll kill you."
Zapp says: "Don't be such a chicken, Kif."
Zapp says: "Teenagers all smoke and they seem pretty on-the-ball."
Kif takes a puff and everyone cheers.
Fry says: "Yeah!"
Zapp says: "Yes, sir!"
Bender says: "Way to suck it!"
Kif says: "Hey, I'm smoking!"
Kif says: "I'm the greatest!"
Kif says: "Oh, monkey trumpets!"
[Scene says: "Martian Torture Chamber."
[Scene says: "Kif is held down on a rack with rope."
Singing Wind says: "You have coughed at our offer of peace."
Singing Wind says: "So you must die!"
Martian #3 says: "The very bead used to crush our dreams shall be used to crush your bones."
Kif says: "Well, actually, I don't have bones."
The Martians ignore him and turn away. The roof opens and Kif screams. The bead is lowered in and he whimpers.
Fry says: "Wait."
Fry says: "That's the bead you traded your land for?"
Leela says: "It's a gigantic diamond!"
Leela says: "That thing must be worth a fortune."
Singing Wind says: "Really?"
The diamond stops and Kif sighs. Bender takes a look at the diamond through an eye glass and stutters.
Bender says: "Oh, Chief, you've made me the happiest girl in the world!"
He hugs Singing Wind and he immediately pushes him away.
Amy says: "Y'know, if you still want your land, we could just trade back for it."
Singing Wind says: "Hmm."
Singing Wind says: "We always thought bead was worthless."
Singing Wind says: "We assumed our ancestors were cheated because they not have concept of ownership."
Bender says: "So we can have the diamond?"
Singing Wind says: "No."
Singing Wind says: "We do have concept of ownership."
Singing Wind says: "You are free to go."
Singing Wind says: "Sorry about all the rustling and kidnapping."
Leela says: "But what about your sacred land?"
Singing Wind says: "Land shmand!"
Singing Wind says: "We don't wanna live on this planet."
Singing Wind says: "It's a dump."
