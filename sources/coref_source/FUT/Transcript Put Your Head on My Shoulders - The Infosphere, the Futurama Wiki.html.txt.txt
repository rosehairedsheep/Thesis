[Opening Credits. Caption says: "Not Based On The Novel by James Fenimore Cooper."
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Lounge."
[Scene says: "On the TV the heads of George Washington and Abraham Lincoln sit on podiums in front of a red curtain."
Lincoln says: "Four score and 1145 years ago our forefathers' foreheads conceived a new nation."
Washington says: "And this Presidents' Day we honoureth those values that my body fought and died for."
Behind the heads the curtain opens and reveals a car showroom. The salesman, a robot with pieces falling off, points to a car.
Malfunctioning Eddie says: "Values like this brand new Plymouth V'Ger!"
Malfunctioning Eddie says: "Hi, I'm Malfunctioning Eddie and I'm malfunctioning so badly I'm practically giving these cars away!"
Amy says: "Hey, let's go car shopping!"
Amy says: "My parents promised if I got all B's they'd buy me a bar, and I got all C's!"
Bender says: "Mind if I tag along?"
Bender says: "I gotta bring my ass in for servicing."
Bender says: "The recall notice says it could burst into flames in a low-speed collision."
Fry says: "No wonder you've been staying at the back of conga lines lately."
Leela says: "I'll get my coat."
Leela says: "Let's go, Bender."
She taps his ass with a rolled-up newspaper and it bursts into flames. Amy, Fry and Leela recoil in horror.
[Scene says: "Malfunctioning Eddie's Showroom."
[Scene says: "A man with an accent introduces himself to Amy."
Victor says: "Hello, I am Victor and I know many things about the art of unloading fine cars on beautiful women."
He kisses her hand.
Leela says: "Uh-huh."
Leela says: "Now tell us she's witty and sophisticated."
Victor says: "Ah-ah-ah!"
Victor says: "A gentleman always sells a lady a car first."
Victor says: "This is the Beta Romeo."
Victor says: "Yes, the Beta Romeo."
Victor says: "Note the cross-your-heart seat belt which protects, lifts and separates."
At the coffee machine Fry pours himself a cup. A salesman puts his hand on his shoulder.
Thundercougarfalconbird salesman says: "Spotted her the minute you walked in, didn't you, sir?"
Thundercougarfalconbird salesman says: "She's a real beauty."
Fry says: "Yup, she's beautiful coffee alright."
Salesman says: "No, the Ford Thundercougarfalconbird!"
Salesman says: "Nothing makes you feel more like a man than a Thundercougarfalconbird."
Salesman says: "So how much were you thinking of spending on this Thundercougarfalconbird?"
Fry says: "Sorry, I'm not here to buy."
Salesman says: "I understand, and it's wonderful you don't care whether anyone questions your sexual orientation."
Fry says: "I care!"
Fry says: "I care plenty!"
Fry says: "I just don't know how to make them stop!"
Salesman says: "One word: Thundercougarfalconbird!"
Amy and Victor sit in the Beta Romeo.
Victor says: "The luxurious seats are stuffed with eagle down and the dashboard inlaid with the beaks of a thousand eagles."
Victor says: "Also, there are some eagles under the floorboards."
Amy says: "That's an awful lot of eagle."
He sighs.
Amy says: "What's wrong?"
Victor says: "It is just..."
Victor says: "the luxury edition has so much more eagle."
Victor says: "It saddens me to think of you missing out."
Amy says: "Oh, don't be sad."
Amy says: "My parents are paying and they're incredibly rich."
Victor raises his right eyebrow and pushes it down again with his finger.
[Scene says: "Service Department."
[Scene says: "Bender lies on a raised platform and a mechanic drills into his back, causing him pain."
[Scene says: "The mechanic lowers him to the floor and he gets up."
Mechanic says: "I installed shock-absorbing bumpers to reduce the risk of catastrophic butt failure."
Bender turns around and gasps at what he sees grafted to his butt.
Bender says: "You, sir, have defaced a national treasure!"
Bender says: "I demand you restore my buttocks to their former glory."
He gets back onto the platform.
Mechanic says: "Alright."
Mechanic says: "But sooner or later that ass is gonna blow, and when it does, I just pray you're not moonin' someone you care about."
[Scene says: "Malfunctioning Eddie's Showroom."
[Scene says: "Amy and Leela look under the bonnet of the Beta Romeo."
Amy says: "Smeesh, Leela!"
Amy says: "This car has everything a beautiful woman like me needs."
Amy says: "Victor said so."
Victor chuckles.
Victor says: "No dog food for Victor tonight."
Leela closes the bonnet.
Amy puts her hand in the air.
Amy says: "60,000!"
Leela sighs.
Victor says: "Oh, I will have to ask my manager."
He walks into Malfunctioning Eddie's office.
Leela says: "Amy, you don't go up from the sticker price."
Amy says: "I thought it was an auction."
Through the office window, we see Victor say something to Eddie. Eddie smiles and they both dance. Victor comes back out again.
Victor says: "He is not too happy."
Amy says: "I'm sorry."
Amy says: "80,000?"
Eddie's head explodes.
[Scene says: "New New York City Street."
[Scene says: "Amy and the others drive back to the Planet Express building."
[Scene says: "Outside, she prepares to park the car."
Amy says: "Uh-oh."
Amy says: "I'm terrible at parallel parking."
The car moves into a space sideways then shunts two cars in front and behind it.
[Scene says: "Planet Express Corridor."
[Scene says: "Fry and Leela walk past Hermes' office."
Hermes says: "You're bogarting my patience."
The door opens and Hermes walks out.
Leela says: "Hermes, who were you yelling at?"
Hermes says: "Myself."
Hermes says: "I asked myself a Valentine's Day off, but I was in no mood for any of my shenanigans."
Fry says: "Valentine's Day's coming?"
Fry says: "Oh, crap!"
Fry says: "I forgot to get a girlfriend again."
Fry says: "Well, since neither of us has a date, why don't we..."
Fry says: "?"
Leela says: "You just assume I can't get a Valentine's date?"
Fry says: "Shall we say eight o'clock?"
Enter Amy.
Amy says: "Hey, I'm taking my new car out for a spin to Mercury."
Amy says: "Anybody wanna come?"
Fry says: "Yeah, OK."
Fry says: "What's the weather like?"
Amy says: "The usual: Boiling lead, oceans of lava."
Fry says: "So, what?"
Fry says: "Shorts?"
[Scene says: "Amy's Car."
[Scene says: "They drive across the Mercurial surface listening to music."
Fry says: "Boy, this A."
Fry says: "C."
Fry says: "is incredible!"
Fry says: "Boy, this heater is incredible!"
Fry says: "I'd better turn up the A."
Fry says: "C."
Fry says: "some more."
Amy says: "Hey, how about some icy margaritas?"
Fry says: "We're slowing down!"
Amy says: "Don't worry."
Amy says: "I'll hit the fuel guzzler!"
She presses a button and the car accelerates.
Fry says: "Uh-oh!"
Amy says: "It's OK, I have an emergency phone."
She picks up a make-up case and applies blusher to her cheeks.
Fry says: "What are you doing?"
Amy says: "Spluh!"
Amy says: "It's a video-phone."
Amy says: "Hello?"
Amy says: "Septuple-A?"
The sun beats down on the planet. Beads of sweat pour down Fry's face. He leans back over the seat and pulls the hood over the car.
Fry says: "Phew!"
Amy finishes her call and sighs.
Amy says: "It'll be a couple hours."
Amy says: "Oh, I'm gonna get sweat on my sweat-suit."
She pulls the zip on her top down.
Fry says: "Hey, tell me something: You've got all this money, how come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?"
Amy says: "I guess 'cause my parents keep telling me to be more ladylike."
Amy says: "As though!"
Fry says: "I've been there."
Fry says: "My folks were always on me to groom myself and wear underpants."
Fry says: "What am I, the Pope?"
Amy laughs.
Amy says: "Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd be all, "Straighten your Pope hat," and, "Put on your good vestments."
Amy says: ""  You know, Fry, it's nice to find someone I can talk to about stuff, and junk."
Fry says: "Yeah, it's like we feel the same way about junk and stuff, or, whatever."
He smiles. She smiles back.
[Scene says: "Mercury Surface."
[Scene says: "Later, the sun is setting and the Septuple-A recovery truck arrives."
[Scene says: "A man gets out and sees the car hood is steamed up."
[Scene says: "He laughs, rubs off the condensation and peers inside."
[Scene says: "Amy and Fry each hold a hand of cards."
[Scene says: "The man sighs disappointedly."
[Cut to says: "Amy's Car."
[Cut to says: "The recovery truck tows it."
Amy says: "So while they're towin' us, you wanna do it?"
Fry says: "Yeah."
They kiss and disappear below the seats. The man laughs again.
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Meeting Room."
[Scene says: "The next morning, the staff sit around the table as Hermes presents a chart to them."
Hermes says: "Which concludes the summary of the movie I saw last night."
Hermes says: "Now, any old business?"
All says: "No."
Hermes says: "Any new business?"
All says: "No."
Hermes says: "Anyone spend the night together?"
Everyone except Fry and Amy replies "No".
Amy says: "Yep."
Fry says: "Kind of."
Everyone gasps.
Bender says: "What?"
Hermes says: "Oh, my God!"
Amy says: "We ran out of fuel on Mercury and one thing led to another."
Fry says: "And it led there again when we got home."
He and Amy chuckle.
Bender says: "Congratulations, Fry, you snagged the perfect girlfriend."
Bender says: "Amy's rich, she's probably got other characteristics."
Leela says: "Bender!"
Leela says: "Romance isn't about money."
Bender says: "Oh, so it's just coincidence that Zoidberg here is desperately poor and miserably lonely?"
Bender says: "Puh-lease!"
Leela says: "For your information, it's because he's hideous."
Zoidberg sighs.
Hermes says: "Well I think Amy and Fry go together like a lime and coconut."
Farnsworth says: "Do I hear wedding bells?"
Fry says: "What?"
Fry says: "No!"
Farnsworth says: "Really?"
Farnsworth says: "Oh, dear."
He pats the side of his head. Zoidberg sighs.
Zoidberg says: "You're both very lucky."
Zoidberg says: "I'd pay anything to end my miserable loneliness."
Zoidberg says: "If only I weren't so desperately poor."
Bender says: "Wait."
Bender says: "You mean people will pay good money for romance?"
Bender says: "Hmm."
[Scene says: "Courtroom."
[Scene says: "The judge bangs his gavel."
Judge says: "$500 and time served."
Bender says: "Stupid anti-pimping laws!"
Bender says: "Well, pay the man!"
He struts out. His two Hookerbots follow him.
Hookerbot says: "Bender, honey, we love you!"
Bender says: "Shut up, baby, I know it!"
[Scene says: "Planet Express Corridor."
[Scene says: "Bender hammers a sign on a door that has "Bender's Computing Dating Service."
[Scene says: "Discreet And Discrete" written on it."
Bender says: "Ah, computer dating."
Bender says: "It's like pimping but you rarely have to use the phrase "upside your head"."
Leela says: "Bender, this is stupid."
Leela says: "Why would anyone come to you for romantic help?"
Bender says: "Hey!"
Bender says: "Don't make me go upside your head!"
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Zoidberg's Office."
[Scene says: "Zoidberg files his claws while Hermes knocks on the supply room door."
Hermes says: "Fry!"
Hermes says: "Amy!"
Hermes says: "Put your pants back on!"
Hermes says: "I need a stapler."
He struggles to open the locked door. Zoidberg blocks his way.
Zoidberg says: "Stop!"
Zoidberg says: "Stop!"
Zoidberg says: "If you interrupt the mating dance the male will become enraged and maul us with his fearsome gonad."
[Cut to says: "Planet Express: Supply Room."
Fry says: "Wait, why aren't we making out?"
Amy says: "I 'unno."
They kiss and drop to the floor.
[Scene says: "Planet Express Corridor."
[Scene says: "Outside the lounge, Larry, Lou and a saleswoman from Alien Overlord & Taylor queue to use Bender's dating service."
[Cut to says: "Planet Express: Lounge."
[Cut to says: "Bender has set up his dating service at the table and is about to interview a client."
Bender says: "OK, Mister..."
Bender says: "?"
Zapp says: "Uh, Smith!"
Zapp says: "Zapp Smith."
Zapp says: "Uh, Brannigan."
Bender says: "Just check off the things you're looking for in a love partner."
He hands Zapp a sheet of paper.
Zapp says: "Let's see..."
Zapp says: "Oh, yes!"
Zapp says: "Mmm, I'll just have everything on the menu."
He punches out the rest of the holes and hands it back to Bender.
Bender says: "Now to run it through our high-speed romance-a-logical data-fier."
Bender says: "Say hello to Miss Right!"
Zapp says: "Hello!"
He rubs the paper against his chest.
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Supply Room."
[Scene says: "Amy and Fry finish making out."
[Scene says: "Fry gasps."
Fry says: "Wow!"
Fry says: "We're great kissers!"
Amy says: "Yeah!"
Amy says: "Hey, later, you wanna drive out to Europa?"
Amy says: "We could have a picnic and spit watermelon seeds at Jupiter."
Fry says: "Hey, yeah!"
Fry says: "I used to spit at stuff back in the 20th century."
Fry says: "Ah, it's cool how we sort of think exactly alike, and junk."
Amy says: "Yeah."
Amy says: "Y'know, Fry, I really like hanging out with you."
Fry is shocked.
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Hangar."
[Scene says: "Leela welds a section of the cargo lift while Fry paces backwards and forwards."
Fry says: "Everything was going great."
Fry says: "Then, all of a sudden, she's talking about hanging out."
Fry says: "Hanging out?"
Fry says: "She's getting way too serious."
Fry says: "I'm not a one woman man, Leela."
Leela says: "You'll be back to zero soon enough."
Fry says: "Don't you get it?"
Fry says: "She's smothering me."
Amy walks past.
Amy says: "Hi."
Fry says: "You see?"
Fry says: "You see?"
Fry says: "Now she's bothering me when I'm at work."
Fry says: "I'm doing my job, there's Amy; I spend a few hours selecting a candy from the machine, there's Amy; I wake up the morning after sleeping with Amy, there's Amy!"
Leela says: "I think you're over reacting."
Fry says: "Am I?"
Fry says: "I mean, I'm pulling down delivery boy money."
Leela says: "Fry, she's pulling down billionaire trust-fund money."
Fry says: "Then she wants me as a trophy husband."
Fry says: "Leela, you gotta come to Europa with us."
Fry says: "I can't be alone with her."
Amy arrives with a picnic basket.
Amy says: "So, ready for a secluded picnic with just you and me?"
Fry says: "Hey, you know who loves secluded picnics with just you and me?"
Fry says: "Uh, Dr."
Fry says: "Zoidberg."
Zoidberg, scavenging through a dustbin, looks up.
Zoidberg says: "Did someone say something about a free hot meal?"
[Scene says: "Amy, Fry and Zoidberg listen to Scruffy the Cat's Moons of Jupiter as they drive to Europa."
[Scene says: "They pass the orbiting Monolith from 2001: A Space Odyssey which has an "Out of Order" note taped to it and drive across the icy surface."
[Cut to says: "Amy's Car."
[Cut to says: "Zoidberg eats the contents of the picnic basket."
Zoidberg says: "Mmm, I haven't eaten since Tuesday!"
Zoidberg says: "Bird eggs, animal slices..."
Zoidberg says: "All gone!"
Zoidberg says: "Can I drive?"
Amy says: "No."
Amy says: "So, Fry, you busy tomorrow?"
Amy says: "I got two tickets to the big ape fight."
Fry says: "Jeez, we're already planning to spend Valentine's Day together."
Fry says: "Isn't that enough?"
Amy says: "OK, sure."
Amy says: "What do you wanna do for Valentine's Day?"
Fry says: "Oh, so all of a sudden we're spending Valentine's Day together?"
Fry says: "That's it, Amy, we have to talk."
Fry says: "Zoidberg, you drive."
Zoidberg says: "Wahoo!"
[Cut to says: "Outside Amy's Car."
[Cut to says: "The car tips as they change places."
Fry says: "Pardon me, excuse me."
[Cut to says: "Amy's Car."
[Cut to says: "Zoidberg is at the wheel while Fry and Amy are in the back."
Zoidberg says: "Ah, I'll just turn the wheel to maximum fastness!"
He turns it. Amy screams.
Fry says: "Amy, you know how at first you like chocolate but then you start to get tired of it because it always wants to hang out with you?"
Amy says: "Huh?"
Amy says: "You don't like chocolate?"
Fry says: "Look, could chocolate just let me finish?"
Zoidberg says: "Vroom, vroom!"
Zoidberg says: "And the winner of the big car race is..."
Zoidberg says: "Hot Rod Zoidberg!"
He mimes a crowd cheering.
Something in the front snaps. Zoidberg has pulled the wheel off.
Zoidberg says: "Uh-oh."
Zoidberg says: "Here, you drive!"
He offers the wheel to Fry. The car spins out of control, hitting chunks of ice. It heads straight for a huge mountain of ice. Fry screams and the car crashes.
[Scene says: "Europa Surface."
[Scene says: "Fry comes to."
[Scene says: "Zoidberg looks over him."
Zoidberg says: "Fry?"
Zoidberg says: "Are you alright?"
Fry says: "Ow!"
Fry says: "My head is killing me."
Fry says: "What happened?"
Fry says: "Was anybody hurt?"
Zoidberg says: "No, no, no, no, no, of course not."
Zoidberg says: "Nobody but you."
Zoidberg says: "I'm afraid your body was badly damaged in the crash."
Fry says: "How badly?"
Zoidberg says: "That's it over there."
Zoidberg says: "Don't worry, I managed to keep your head alive with some quick surgery."
Fry moves his eyes up and down.
Fry says: "Where is it?"
Zoidberg points.
Zoidberg says: "There."
Fry turns to his right and sees Amy's head. Zoidberg has grafted his head onto her left shoulder.
Amy says: "Looks like we'll be spending a lot more time together, Fry!"
Fry screams.
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab."
[Scene says: "Farnsworth and Zoidberg inspect Fry's body."
[Scene says: "Leela tuts."
Leela says: "This sort of thing always happens with office romances."
Zoidberg says: "Don't worry, Fry, we'll have your body all fixed up in a few days."
Zoidberg says: "Upsy daisy!"
He walks out of the room, hitting the body on the walls on the way out. Fry whimpers.
Fry says: "Well, Amy, I'll try not to interfere with your life too much."
Amy appears to pick her nose.
Amy says: "Fry!"
Fry says: "Ooh, sorry."
Fry says: "I guess I control that arm."
He waves the arm around and hoots.
Amy says: "So, what was it you wanted to talk about before we crashed anyway?"
Fry says: "Oh, that."
Fry says: "I'll meet you in the closet."
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Supply Room."
Fry says: "Amy, I really like you, as a friend."
Fry says: "But I think we're spending too much time together."
Amy says: "You're breaking up with me?"
Fry says: "I just think we should start seeing other people."
Amy says: "But, I was really having fun."
Amy says: "If that's how you feel."
Fry says: "I'm sorry, but it is."
Amy says: "Well, whatever."
Amy says: "Hey, listen, as long as we're not seeing each other, you mind if I ask someone else out for Valentine's Day?"
Fry says: "Huh?"
Amy says: "I mean, unless it would make you feel bad, being a third wheel."
Fry says: "Hey, I can get a date too."
Fry says: "Now that I'm single, I'll attract all sorts of women!"
Amy says: "With my body I think you might only attract one sort of woman."
Fry says: "Oh!"
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Lounge."
[Scene says: "Bender drinks from a bottle."
[Scene says: "Leela sits down and plays with his "Dating Consultant" nameplate nonchalantly."
Leela says: "So, how's business?"
Bender opens his chest cabinet, revealing a huge pile of money. He pulls out a $500 note.
Bender says: "Are you familiar with my friend Al Gore?"
Bender says: "I'm tellin' you, losers get really desperate around Valentine's Day."
Leela says: "Yeah, it's pathetic alright!"
Leela says: "How much?"
Bender says: "500 bucks."
Leela says: "Done."
Bender says: "Zapp Brannigan OK?"
Leela says: "No!"
Bender says: "600."
[Cut to says: "Planet Express: Hangar."
[Cut to says: "Enter Leela who sees Fry and Amy playing table tennis."
[Cut to says: "Fry sees Leela."
Fry says: "Oh, hey, Leela, uh, can I talk to you for a minute?"
Fry says: "In private?"
Amy says: "Oh, no problem."
She puts her fingers in her ears and sings to herself in Chinese.
Fry says: "This is an emergency."
Fry says: "Amy made Valentine's plans with some goon and I'm gonna be stuck there, lonely and miserable."
Fry says: "Will you be my date, please?"
Leela says: "You're too late, Fry."
Leela says: "I'm sharing Valentine's Day with a very special man."
Leela says: "He's not Zapp Brannigan or anything!"
Fry says: "Then I have no choice but to do something so pitiful and embarrassing that I'm ashamed to tell you about it."
Leela says: "Bender's in his office."
Fry says: "Thanks."
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Lounge."
[Scene says: "Amy continues to sing while Fry does business with Bender."
Bender says: "I got your hook-up, Fry."
Bender says: "Now, my usual fee's 500 bucks, but seeing as how it's you, I'll need it in advance."
[Scene says: "Amy's Apartment."
[Scene says: "Amy dresses herself while Fry "helps"."
Amy says: "OK, Fry, we're done putting on the bra."
Fry says: "Why exactly did you shave your legs anyway?"
Fry says: "Are you expecting something to happen with your Valentine's date?"
Amy says: "What business is it of yours?"
Fry says: "And another thing: You're using an awful lot of make-up there."
Amy says: "This is deodorant."
Fry says: "What does it do?"
The doorbell rings. Amy reaches for her dress.
Amy says: "C'mon in, Gary!"
Amy says: "I'll just be another 20 minutes."
Gary says: "I'll be waiting."
Fry says: "20 minutes?"
Fry says: "You're practically ready now!"
Amy says: "Yeah, but it's good to make them wait a little."
Fry says: "Oh, God, it's true!"
[Scene says: "Elzar's Fine Cuisine."
[Scene says: "Amy, Gary and Fry sit at a table."
[Scene says: "Fry eats a hamburger."
Gary says: "That dress looks great on you."
Amy says: "Thanks."
Fry says: "Where is she?"
Gary says: "I must say, Amy, you're all made up, just like Fry's date."
Gary says: "Get it?"
Amy shakes her head.
Amy says: "Mm-mm."
Fry says: "I've got a date."
Fry says: "She'll be along any minute."
Enter Bender with an old woman.
Bender says: "Fry, look who I found!"
Bender says: "It's Petunia, your dream girl!"
Petunia says: "How's them eats?"
Petunia says: "Don't mind if I do."
Petunia says: "Kids'll be hungry."
Fry says: "She seems a little old for me."
Bender says: "She is well-travelled."
Bender says: "And I don't mean she travels a lot!"
Petunia says: "Wheels fell off my house."
Bender says: "Now how about a rose for the lady?"
Bender says: "Five bucks a pop!"
Gary says: "I'll take one."
Fry says: "Oh, yeah?"
Fry says: "Well I want one too."
Bender says: "Eight bucks."
Bender says: "Demand suddenly skyrocketed."
Bender says: "You all saw it!"
On another table, Leela sits alone. She sighs. Bender arrives.
Bender says: "Leela, meet your future husband Sal."
Sal wears blue overalls and has a cigarette in his mouth. He cringes.
Sal says: "Nice eyeball, eyeball."
Leela says: "Nice ass, ass."
Bender says: "Ooh, sparks!"
Bender says: "Buy her a rose, I guarantee she'll put out!"
Sal considers then sits down.
Sal says: "Eh, I'll take my chances."
Time Lapse. Bender's other clients are also there. Larry eats from Hattie's fork and Zapp makes a toast with his woman who has a five-o'clock shadow.
Zapp says: "Cheers!"
"Woman" says: "Cheers!"
Petunia says: "So tell me about your prospects."
Petunia says: "You a good gambler?"
Petunia says: "What's your game?"
Petunia says: "Bingo?"
Petunia says: "Keno?"
Petunia says: "Wait a minute!"
Petunia says: "You don't have your own body."
Fry says: "No, but I control this arm."
Petunia says: "Slots player, huh?"
Petunia says: "Sorry, but I think I can do better."
She gets up from the table.
Fry says: "Wait, come back, uh, darling."
Petunia says: "Can't, hon', I gotta catch my bus back to Nutley."
Petunia says: "I'd kiss you goodnight but I lost my teeth pulling out a stump."
She walks towards the exit.
Sal says: "So anyways, Leela, I'd love to take a whack at ya but that 10:15 to Nutley ain't goin' nowheres without yours truly behinds the wheel."
Petunia says: "Excuse me, did you say "10:15 to Nutley"?"
Sal says: "Why, yes I dids."
They stare into each others eyes and passionately kiss. Leela turns to Bender.
Leela says: "Bender!"
Leela says: "Did you just round up our dates at the bus station?"
Bender says: "Of course not."
Sal says: "Anybodys else for Nutley?"
Bender's customers get up and head for the door. Zapp's date also leaves.
Zapp says: "Baby, wait!"
Zapp says: "You didn't show me your surprise."
Gary has his arm around Amy.
Gary says: "You know what I'd like to do..."
Gary says: "?"
Fry says: "Oh, jeez, get a room!"
Gary says: "Maybe later."
Fry is shocked.
Fry says: "Hey, I have an idea: Let's all go out for ice cream."
Gary says: "Actually, I thought Amy might like to come back to my place for coffee."
Amy says: "I don't really like coffee."
Gary says: "Neither do I."
Fry is shocked again.
Amy says: "Ooh, I feel a little tipsy!"
Fry is shocked again.
Gary says: "Let me pick up the check."
Fry says: "Nooo!"
Fry says: "Ooh!"
Fry says: "Ow!"
Leela hears Fry and walks to their table just as Amy and Gary are about to leave.
Leela says: "Why, if it isn't my favourite head on Amy's body: Fry."
Fry says: "Oh, Leela!"
Amy says: "We were just on our way out."
Leela says: "Nonsense, the evening's young."
Leela says: "So, Gary, what do you do for a living?"
Gary says: "I'm a banking industry regulator."
Amy sighs.
Leela says: "Really?"
Leela says: "Y'know, I heard that banking industry regulations are really very simple."
Gary says: "Oh, no, that's not true."
Gary says: "You see, modern banking regulations are a product of five different regulatory traditions."
Gary says: "Six if you wanna get technical."
Leela says: "Oh, I do."
Gary says: "It all began in 1410 when a number of noblemen convened..."
Fry and Leela look at each other.
Fry says: "Thank you."
They smile.
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab."
[Scene says: "Zoidberg finishes stitching Fry's head to his neck."
Zoidberg says: "There you are, good as new."
Zoidberg says: "Except for your dorsal fin."
Zoidberg says: "I'm afraid I couldn't find it after the crash."
Fry says: "Can I live without it?"
Zoidberg says: "If you call that living."
Farnsworth says: "I still don't understand why you wouldn't let me graft a laser cannon onto your chest."
Farnsworth says: "To crush those who disobey you."
Farnsworth says: "But I guess we're just two different people."
He and Zoidberg leave.
Fry says: "So, uh, thanks for the ride, Amy."
Fry says: "And I hope there are no hard feelings about your date, or stuff."
Amy says: "It's OK, I had fun."
Amy says: "And if I ever feel lonely I can just look over at this disfiguring scar and think of you."
They smile. Amy leaves. Fry sighs.
Fry says: "Well, anyway, it's nice to have my own body back."
He yawns, stretches and pats his chest. He looks down and sighs. Enter Leela and Bender.
Leela says: "So how's the old corpse?"
Leela says: "Everything hooked up OK?"
Fry stands up.
Fry says: "Seems to be."
Fry says: "My neck's just a little tender."
Fry says: "Ow!"
Fry says: "Listen, Leela."
Fry says: "Thanks for rescuing me last night."
Leela says: "Anytime."
Leela says: "I actually enjoyed hanging out with you."
Enter Bender, counting his profits.
Bender says: "Yep, everything worked out great thanks to good old Bender."
Leela says: "Come on!"
Leela says: "It's not like you intentionally set us up with bad dates so we'd spend Valentine's Day together."
Bender says: "Didn't I, Leela?"
Bender says: "Didn't I?"
He winks and a heart wipe closes the scene but opens up again.
Leela says: "No!"
Leela says: "You didn't!"
Leela says: "You just corralled a bunch of stiffs at the bus station and pocketed our money!"
Bender says: "True."
Bender says: "But in the end, isn't that what Valentine's Day is really all about?"
Leela says: "Yeah."
Fry says: "I guess so."
Fry says: "Watch the neck!"
Fry says: "Watch the neck!"
He kicks Bender's ass and it sparks.
Bender says: "My ass!"
Bender says: "My beautiful ass!"
It explodes.
