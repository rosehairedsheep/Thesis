Ship's Computer says: "Warning, engines will shut down in one second."
Leela says: "That's more like it."
The ship's engines die and it abruptly comes to a stop, throwing the three crew members out of their chairs. The ship drifts into a shady looking area of space.

Hoschel says: "Puke-a-doodle-do."
Leela says: "You're making fun of our ship?"
Leela says: "Your ship is the most beat-up thing I've ever seen, and I've seen Mickey Rourke's head."
Sal says: "Yeah, she's a little Rourky, but you got to gets big time ugly to be five-time winners at a demolition derby."
Fry says: "That's five more times than we've won or even entered."

Sal and Leela are the only two ships left. They struggle to travel towards each other.
<poem>Rich Little says: "Ladies and gentlemen, we are down to our final two ships."
<poem>Rich Little says: "In the storied annals of demolition derby, today will surely be remembered, if only as the day upon which I was absorbed  into that hideous conglomeration once known as the Dixie Chicks."
Leela says: "Buckle your sphincters."
Everybody else on the ship is screaming in terror.
Sal says: "That broad's insanes."
Hoschel says: "But you're insansier, right?"
Sal says: "Nah, I guess nots."
Sal says: "I've decideds to relax and enjoy life from now ons."
They both scream as they steer away from the collision. They crash and when the dust settles the hood pops open and one windshield wiper is working. The crowd cheers. Interior shot of the Planet Express ship shows everybody stunned in horror.
Leela says: "Yes!"
Leela says: "We did it!"
<poem>Rich Little says: "And Planet Express takes the trophy."
The ship hobbles back to the Planet Express building and falls into the hangar. Inside, Fry and Amy move a curtain with a drawing of the ship around the smashed one. In Farnsworth's bedroom Leela and Zoidberg attempt to put the keys back in his stomach.
Leela says: "Now, I'll use the magnet to get the keys back in there."
Zoidberg says: "What?"
Zoidberg says: "You mean I cut a big hole in him for nothing?"
Leela says: "Don't worry, the Professor won't even remember that he has a spaceship."
Farnsworth says: "Ah, my precious spaceship!"
Farnsworth says: "My lone source of joy in the cold December of my days."

Zoidberg says: "Look at me!"
Zoidberg says: "Look at me!"
Zoidberg says: "Look at me!"
Zoidberg says: "Ooh!"
Zoidberg says: "Don't look at me."
The torch sets the whole curtain a blaze and it is quickly consumed. Hermes gasps.
Farnsworth says: "Yes, she's a wonderful ship, all right."
Farnsworth says: "As beautiful now as the day I got botched laser eye surgery."
Farnsworth says: "Great Godzilla's gonads!"
Farnsworth says: "Who wasted precious fuel?"
Farnsworth says: "Answer now or be punished."
Leela says: "All right, fine."
Leela says: "I admit it."
Farnsworth says: "You will be punished."

Indian Boy says: "Most ingenious."
Chinese Boy says: "Ah, Bender?"
Bender says: "Me?"
Bender says: "I, uh cast a spell of darkness."
Bender says: "Pretty imaginative, huh?"
Cubert says: "No, you just did the same thing as me, but with a dumb noise."
Bender says: "Oh..."
Bender says: "You're right."
Bender says: "I'm great in every way except I have no imagination."
Bender says: "All I ever wanted is to play this magical game and I can't."
Dwight says: "Yes, you can."
Dwight says: "You just have to lose yourself in the fantasy."
Dwight says: "You have to believe the impossible is merely preposterous."
Bender says: "Okay."
Bender says: "Here goes."
Bender says: "Visor down."
Bender says: "I believe, I believe."
Bender says: "I did it!"
Bender says: "I imagined something."
Bender says: "For 1."

Bender says: "Uh, um..."
Bender says: "I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood."
The boys cheer as the doors open.
Farnsworth says: "Everybody out of the conference room."
Farnsworth says: "I am calling a conference."
Farnsworth says: "You wasted precious fuel just because you were insulted by some redneck yokel from beyond the stars?"
Leela says: "It was only half a ball."
Farnsworth says: "That's not the point."
Farnsworth says: "Your temper is out of control."
Farnsworth says: "And to think I'd have never even known if it weren't for the lengthy and unsolicited tattling of Dr."
Farnsworth says: "Zoidberg."
Zoidberg says: "She also took home two rolls of Scotch tape."
Farnsworth says: "Thank you, Dr."
Farnsworth says: "Zoidberg."
Farnsworth says: "Hermes, incentivize that employee."
Farnsworth says: "As for you, Leela, I'm letting you off with a warning."
Leela says: "Oh, thank you."
Farnsworth says: "A warning that will be administered by this 50,000-volt shock collar."
Leela says: "Zoidberg, I'm gonna put my boot so far up your cloaca, you'll be..."
Leela says: "Ow!"
Farnsworth says: "The collar will be triggered any time your thoughts turn to violence."
<poem>Leela says: "Ouch!"
Farnsworth says: "Profanity."
Leela says: "Son of a..."
Leela says: "Ow!"
Farnsworth says: "Or perversions of a sexual nature."
Leela says: "Ow!"
Hermes says: "Sorry, it's the only collar they had in stock at Office Depot."
Zoidberg says: "I hope you picked up some Scotch tape while you were there."
Bender says: "That's a good one."
He puts his arms around Zoidberg and laughs as Leela struggles to her feet. She grabs Bender's arm and activates the shock collar sending the charge through Bender and to Zoidberg. Zoidberg screams in pain as he is shocked.
[Scene says: "An episode of The Scary Door."
Narrator says: "Imagine, if you will, an announcer you can barely understand."

Narrator says: "It's remotely possible that he just said something about..."
Narrator says: "The Scary Door."
Pan down to a normal farm day. Pan over to a barn with chickens and a tractor around it. Suddenly two UFO's enter and start destroying everything. Soldiers fire artillery and bullets at the hordes of ships.
Soldier says: "Firing, sir!"
Soldier says: "It's all over."
Soldier says: "Our guns and bombs are useless against the aliens."
Farmer says: "The saucers!"
Farmer says: "Theys'a crashin'!"
The saucers are crashing into the ground and barn. A view of a field shows many saucers slamming into the ground and the farmer pulls himself up to watch.
Narrator says: "In the end, it was not guns or bombs that defeated the aliens, but that humblest of all God's creatures, the Tyrannosaurus Rex."
A Tyrannosaurus Rex smacks a UFO to the ground and eats the alien inside. Leela turns off the TV. She is sitting in the lounge with Hermes.
Leela says: "I can't believe TiVo suggested that piece of..."
Leela says: "collar."

Bender screams.
Indian Boy says: "What do we do?"
Indian Boy says: "What do we do?"
Bender says: "Wait, I know."
Bender says: "I make use of my rod of fireballs."
<poem>Cubert says: "Everyone knows red dragons are immune to fireballs as well as all other forms of incendiary attack."
Bender says: "Yes, but I aim not at the dragon but at the river itself to create a shroud of steam through which we can escape."
ALL says: "Whoa!"
Dwight says: "Sweet pony of Sierra Leone, it worked!"
Bender laughs victoriously.
Chinese Boy says: "We did it!"
Cubert says: "Success!"

Farnsworth Monkey says: "Mmm."
Farnsworth Monkey says: "I see."
Farnsworth Monkey says: "Show me on this anatomically correct doll exactly where he touched you."

Zoidberg says: "You've got a skull embedded in your head."
Leela says: "You're absolutely right, Doctor."
Leela says: "Can the collar come off now?"
Zoidberg says: "Let me just peel your head a little and see if I can get that skull out."
<poem>Zoidberg says: "So, you tell me, little miss expert, why always with the temper?"
<poem>Zoidberg says: "Calm down for once and think."
<poem>Zoidberg says: "Here, enjoy a relaxing spritz from my empathy bladder."
Zoidberg says: "What is it, already?"
Zoidberg says: "What's the cause of your anger?"
Leela says: "I guess I would have to say, I hate you."
Zoidberg says: "I'm beginning to understand."
Zoidberg says: "It all goes back to your parents."
Leela says: "What?"
Zoidberg says: "You harbour resentment because they pushed you to study medicine when all you ever wanted was to be a song-and-dance man."
Zoidberg says: "Why?"
Zoidberg says: "Whyyy?"
Leela says: "I was raised in an orphanarium."
Leela says: "My parents are sewer mutants who I never even met until a few years ago."
Zoidberg says: "Then you've got to go to them and work this song-and-dance stuff out."
Zoidberg says: "Maybe have them cook me nice dinner."
Zoidberg says: "No scallions."
Zoidberg says: "I hate them."
Zoidberg says: "Amy, cancel my appointments."
Amy says: "Stop calling me."

Leela says: "I would, but..."
Leela says: "Ow!"

An opening montage of "Tea with Titans" is shown. Morbo is seen in pictures with Rich Little, Zapp Brannigan, the Space Pope and Billionare Bot.
Morbo says: "Thank you for joining us, Mom."
Mom says: "My pleasure, sugarplum."
Morbo says: "Mom, you control the world's only dark matter mine."
Morbo says: "Tell us, why are fuel prices so high?"
Mom says: "Oh!"
Mom says: "It's terrible, isn't it?"
Mom says: "Dark matter is just so rare nowadays, but we'll keep pinching loaf after loaf from the bowels of the earth, even if I lose money on every log."
Morbo says: "If you are losing money, how did you post record profits last quarter?"
Morbo holds up a Quarterly Report book for "Mombil." It shows Mom squeezing a drop of liquid out of the Earth. There is a dollar sign in the droplet. Mom nervously clears her throat.
Mom says: "You look thin, care for one of my famous pecan clusters?"
<poem>Mom says: "Do people care enough to drill for dark matter even in an Alaskan wildlife refuge?"
<poem>Mom says: "People do."
Farnsworth says: "Greedy old hag, taste the wrath of my fuzzy slipper."

Mom says: "Burn, you damn thighs."
Mom says: "Burn!"
Igner says: "Mommy, are you upset 'cause of the dark matter shortage?"
Mom says: "There is no shortage, you moronic ass-brain!"
Igner says: "There's not?"
Igner says: "But you said..."
Mom says: "Allow me to explain."
Mom says: "Suppose this hand represents current reserves of dark matter and this hand represents consumer demand."
Igner says: "Uh-huh."
She slaps him with both hands.
Cut back to Planet Express. Farnsworth is still going on while he mixes a fluid in two boiling tubes.
Farnsworth says: "I just bet you'd like to know why I'm so angry about this dark matter shortage."
Farnsworth says: "I bet very much you'd like to know."
Amy says: "You're right, Professor."
Amy says: "We would like to know."
Farnsworth says: "Really?"
Farnsworth says: "I didn't think anyone was interested."
Farnsworth says: "It all started 30-odd years ago."
Farnsworth says: "I was working in Mom's laboratories for the third time after twice before realizing how evil she was and vowing never to work for her again."
Farnsworth says: "But somehow the rich, wrong stench of her boney charms kept calling me back."
Everybody announces their disgust.
Zoidberg says: "Don't stop, Professor."
Zoidberg says: "I'm getting aroused."
<poem>Farnsworth says: "Back in those days, dark matter was just a worthless inert curiosity, and I was smashing it in a particle accelerator, in an ill-conceived attempt to create a more durable harpsichord wax."
<poem>Farnsworth says: "But, as Deepak Chopra taught us, quantum physics means anything can happen at any time for no reason."
<poem>Farnsworth says: "Also, eat plenty of oatmeal and animals never had a war."
<poem>Farnsworth says: "Who's the real animals?"
<poem>Farnsworth says: "And thus against all probabilities..."
<poem>Farnsworth says: "it happened."
<poem>Farnsworth says: "[The dark matter particles in the particle accelerator begin colliding and exploding."
<poem>Farnsworth says: "A large explosion leaves only a single item - the single non-local metaparticle crystal."
Younger Farnsworth says: "Dang!"
Farnsworth says: "I'm sure I don't need to explain that all dark matter in the universe is linked in the form of a single non-local meta-particle."
Amy says: "Guhh!"
Amy says: "Stop patronizing us."
Farnsworth says: "So, in one instant, I had transformed all dark matter everywhere into a new crystalline form..."
Farnsworth says: "..."
Farnsworth says: "making it the most potent fuel since primitive man first ignited mastodon flatulence to heat his cave."
Younger Mom says: "I'm intrigued, Hubert."
Younger Mom says: "You have my undivided attention."
Mom is breast feeding Walt and Larry at the same time. Farnsworth pulls out a match and ignites a ball of dark matter causing combustion. It blows the two of them to the ground and the babies start crying.
Younger Mom says: "Shut up, you milk-sucking leeches!"
Younger Mom says: "A new super fuel, eh?"
Younger Mom says: "We're rich."
Younger Farnsworth says: "Indeed, we are."
Younger Mom says: "Not you, we."
Younger Mom says: "Us, we."
Younger Mom says: "I'm getting back together with my ex-husband."
Younger Farnsworth says: "Wernstrom!"
Younger Wernstrom says: "You've been played, Farnsworth."
Younger Wernstrom says: "Played like a cheap harpsichord."
Younger Mom says: "Walt, fire that employee like Mommy taught you."
Walt pushes a button on a toy. Farnsworth finds this cute, but it forced through the wall by a large piston. Cut back to present times.
Leela says: "Professor, maybe I can help you get even with Mom."
Leela says: "I spend most of my time thinking about how to get revenge on a bad boss."
Fry says: "Me, too."
Zoidberg says: "Ditto!"
Hermes says: "Likewise."
Amy says: "I made a blinding powder."
Farnsworth says: "Thanks, but that won't be necessary because I have the ultimate weapon."
Farnsworth says: "You see, in the instant the energy crystal was created, there also came into being an opposite crystal made of pure anti-backwards energy."
ALL says: "Wow!"
Hermes says: "So?"
Farnsworth says: "So, this!"
Farnsworth says: "If ever the two crystals should meet, their wave functions would collapse like Raymond Burr's trampoline, once again rendering all dark matter inert and useless as fuel."
Hermes says: "But then we'll have no fuel."
Farnsworth says: "But once we free society from dependence on Mom's dark matter, scientists will finally care enough to develop cleaner, alternative fuels."
Fry says: "Scientists like you!"
Farnsworth says: "No, not me."
Farnsworth says: "I'm too busy developing makeup for dogs."
Farnsworth says: "That's where the money is."
Leela says: "This is our chance to teach Mom a lesson."
Leela says: "Come on!"
Leela says: "Let's take the anti-crystal and shove it up Mom's regular crystal."
ALL says: "Yeah."
Hermes says: "Fight the power!"
Farnsworth says: "There's just one, small problem, and it's a big one."
Farnsworth says: "I hid the crystal and I can't remember where."
Hermes says: "Well, surely it's just a matter of waiting till you next move your bowels and then using a potato masher..."
Farnsworth says: "Don't you think I already tried that?"
Farnsworth says: "No."
Farnsworth says: "I'm afraid, the crystal is lost forever."
Cut to the crystal being used as a die by the boys playing Dungeons & Dragons.
Dwight says: "Nine?"
Dwight says: "You did it."
Dwight says: "You outwitted the fungus."
ALL says: "Woohoo!"
Chinese Boy says: "Who needs girls?"
[Scene says: "HAL Institute - Dr."
[Scene says: "Perceptron's office."
[Scene says: "Bender is sitting in a circle with Mad Hatterbot, Roberto, Convenience Store Bot, a Teapot bot and Rosie from the Jetsons."
Dr. Perceptron says: "Since you have all proven resistant to individualized hammer therapy, I now prescribe group therapy."
He presses a button and hammers begin hitting the robots on the head. The Teapot bot is shattered by its hammer and Rosie cleans the mess up.
Rosie says: "Everything must be clean, very clean."
Rosie says: "That's why the dog had to die."
Rosie says: "He was a dirty dog."
Rosie says: "Dirty, dirty."
Rosie says: "Also, that boy, Elroy."
Rosie says: "Dirty, dirty."
Dr. Perceptron says: "Who would like to share their feelings?"
Intercom Assistant says: "I feel unappreciated at work."
Dr. Perceptron says: "What?"
Dr. Perceptron says: "I can barely understand you."
Intercom Assistant says: "I said I feel..."
Mad Hatterbot says: "Change places."
Everybody switches seats.
Roberto says: "Well, well."
Roberto says: "Looks like old Roberto is the focus of attention now."
Roberto says: "Stop looking at me."
<poem>Dr. Perceptron says: "Calm down, Roberto."
<poem>Dr. Perceptron says: "Tell us about your childhood."
Roberto says: "I was designed by a team of engineers attempting to build an insane robot."
Roberto says: "But it seems they failed."
Convenience Store Bot says: "Um, actually..."
<poem>Bender says: "Look, we have to accept the fact that we all have a serious problem."
<poem>Bender says: "And if we ever wanna get out of here, the first step is to admit it."
Roberto says: "Amen."
Dr. Perceptron says: "Good, Bender."
Rosie says: "That's right."
Bender says: "There's a band of river trolls living in the moat and they may have no intention of letting us out of this castle, unless we hand over the Golden Scepter of Zanthor."
Roberto says: "Say what?"
Roberto says: "Dude's crazy."
Dr. Perceptron says: "Bender, please, try to..."
Bender says: "I know not of this Bender."
Bender says: "I am Titanius Anglesmith, fancy man of Cornwood."
Dr. Perceptron says: "You are suffering a breakdown."
Dr. Perceptron says: "Now stop."
Dr. Perceptron says: "Hammer time."
Dr. Perceptron says: "I'm in your seat."
Dr. Perceptron says: "I forgot we had changed places."
Mad Hatterbot says: "Change places?"
[Scene says: "Planet Express - Observatory."
<poem>Farnsworth says: "Good news, everyone!"
Amy says: "You perfected dog mascara?"
Farnsworth says: "Far from it."
Farnsworth says: "If you ask me, they look like a bunch of hookers."
Farnsworth says: "But what I have invented is a means of locating the missing crystal."
Farnsworth says: "When I push this button, the crystal will emit a high-frequency stink."
Zoidberg says: "Hurray!"
Farnsworth says: "There."
Farnsworth says: "Now, with any luck I'll detect it with my smelling aid."
Farnsworth says: "I just pray to all powerful Atheismo that we find it before Mom does."
Hermes says: "Do you smell the crystal, Professor?"
Farnsworth says: "No, damn it!"
Farnsworth says: "Just the alluring scent of Obsession for spaniels."
A dog sprays perfume on another dog and sniffs its behind. Cut to the anti-backwards crystal die, emitting a fume.
Dwight says: "Dude."
Dwight says: "Who whipped an egger?"
CubertHe who smelled it, dealt it.
Dwight says: "Yeah?"
Dwight says: "Well, he who denied it, supplied it."
Cubert says: "Well, he who articulated it, particulated it."
Dwight says: "Well, he who refuted it, tooted it."
Cubert says: "Stalemate."
Cut to Mom's office, her map is flashing with an alarm.
Mom says: "Jesus craps."
Mom says: "The anti-backwards crystal."
She slaps Larry.
Larry says: "Ow!"
Larry says: "Ah..."
Larry says: "sorry?"
Mom says: "Relax, it's not your fault."
Mom says: "With that crystal, Farnsworth could completely destroy my dark matter empire."
Mom says: "I underestimated that sagging old bag of bones and gonads."
Inger says: "Is that man bad?"
Mom says: "Very bad, Igner."
Mom says: "And that's why I need you three to go steal the anti-crystal away from him."
Mom says: "But be careful."
Mom says: "You'll need all your stoogely cunning."
[Scene says: "A cube van stops in front of Planet Express."
[Scene says: "The door bell rings and Fry answers."
Walt says: "Exterminators."
Fry says: "Oh, great."
Fry says: "What do we got?"
Fry says: "Wall gophers?"
Fry says: "Toilet snails?"
Walt says: "No, I'm afraid you've got owls."
Walt says: "Over there, see?"
Fry looks around and doesn't see anything. Walt hits Igner.
Igner says: "Ow!"
Walt says: "Dump the bag, you nitwit."
Igner turns to grab the bag, hitting Larry in the head with a ladder.
Larry says: "Hey, watch it."
<poem>Walt says: "Quiet, you."
<poem>Walt says: "Ow!"
Fry says: "I was looking over there for a long time but I didn't see any..."
Fry says: "Oh, there they are."
Fry says: "Gross."
Walt says: "We've got to act fast."
Walt says: "Larry, get out the geigersniffer."
Larry says: "I don't know, Walt."
Larry says: "You're just gonna hit me with it."
Walt says: "No."
Walt says: "I'm going to hit you with this."
<poem>Fry says: "Those three exterminators are hilarious."
Amy says: "Really?"
Amy says: "I don't think so."
Leela says: "Me, neither."
Leela says: "Now, Sex and the City, that's funny."
Cut to the boys playing Dungeons & Dragons.
Dwight says: "After wandering aimlessly in the swamp, you suddenly..."
Dwight says: "wander aimlessly in the swamp."
The door opens behind them and the ticking of the geigersniffer is heard. Larry, Walt and Igner enter and hone in on the anti-backwards crystal.
Walt says: "There it is."
<poem>Cubert says: "Uh, excuse you as you apparently didn't notice, we're trying to traverse the Quagmire of Slogdonia."
Walt says: "I'm sorry, little boy."
Walt says: "You see, we're owl exterminators."
Igner says: "We are owl extermin..."
Igner says: "Ow!"
Walt says: "And what we have here is an owl egg that's about to hatch into an owl larva."
Walt says: "So, if you don't mind, we'll just take this and..."
Cubert says: "What are you, stupid?"
Cubert says: "That's a dodecahedral crystal I found hidden in the downstairs walrus tank."
Dwight says: "And I wrote numbers on it so we could use it as a D12, 'cause I have the best handwriting."
Cubert says: "Do not."
Dwight says: "Do too."
Cubert says: "Do not."
Dwight says: "Do too."
Cubert says: "You win this round."
Farnsworth enters.
Farnsworth says: "What's going on here?"
Igner says: "We're owl exterminators."
Farnsworth says: "Oh?"
Farnsworth says: "Then you won't have any problem exterminating this owl."
He pulls an owl out from behind him. It is perched on his arm. Igner nervously attempts to grasp the owl with a pair of pliers, but it flies away before he catches it. The owl torments the three of them by flying around their heads. The anti-backwards crystal falls to the floor and rolls to Farnsworth's feet. He sniffs a little more and bends over to pick it up, cracking his back a few times in the process.
Farnsworth says: "My anti-backwards crystal."
Farnsworth says: "So it's you three."
Farnsworth says: "I should have known Mom would send her brainless brood to do her dirty work."
Farnsworth says: "Walt, the leader among imbeciles."
Walt says: "Hey!"
Walt says: "They resent that."
Farnsworth says: "Larry, the sniveling middle child."
Larry says: "Sorry."
Larry says: "Thank you."
Farnsworth says: "And you, Igner."
Farnsworth says: "The evil I could tolerate, but the stupidity..."
<poem>Igner says: "We're owl exterminators."
Farnsworth says: "Good God."
Farnsworth says: "Just knowing we're in the same genus makes me embarrassed to call myself homo."
<poem>Igner says: "Thanks for the crystal."
Mom slaps Igner. Cut to Planet Express. The hanger doors open and Fry is seen adjusting something in the ship's thruster with a large screw driver.
Fry says: "There."
Fry says: "The repairs are complete."
Farnsworth says: "Rake up some dark matter and top off the tank."
Leela says: "Well, there isn't any dark matter."
Leela says: "Nibbler hasn't pooped at all."
Leela says: "And he ate a whole family of koalas last night."
Leela says: "Nibbler!"
Leela says: "Nibbler!"
Farnsworth says: "I'm not interested in the whereabouts of your cutesy-fruitsy space rat."
Farnsworth says: "The only thing that matters right now is this crystal."
<poem>Leela says: "Ow!"
Farnsworth says: "And be careful with that crystal."
[Scene says: "Bender is laying flat in a chair."
[Scene says: "He has mice and spiders crawling all over him, there is an alarm sounding off, the lights are flashing and there is a axe device swinging close to his head like a pendulum."
Dr. Perceptron says: "Even relaxation therapy has failed."
Dr. Perceptron says: "Diagnosis, insanity."
Dr. Perceptron says: "Nurse, schedule a robotomy for Bender."
Nurse Ratchet says: "Yes, Doctor."
Nurse Ratchet says: "I'll get the tools from the shed."
Dr. Perceptron says: "It's a very painful procedure."
Dr. Perceptron says: "So until then, just try to relax."
The rats, spiders and swinging blades are placed on Bender again.
[Scene says: "The Planet Express ship is flying towards Mom's Dark Matter Mine."
[Scene says: "A small camera poking out of the ice watches them."
[Scene says: "Cut to Mom watching the camera's feed."
[Scene says: "She laughs and Walt joins in with her, Larry joins soon after that."
Mom says: "What are you laughing at?"
Larry says: "Your laugh."
Larry says: "It's just so infectious."
Mom says: "So's herpes."
Mom says: "Now, shut up!"
Mom says: "You and Walt, lead the killbots to the surface and blow Farnsworth out of the sky."
Walt says: "What about Igner?"
Mom says: "That hairless ape?"
Mom says: "I swear."
Mom says: "When he came out I flipped a coin whether to keep him or the after-birth."
Walt says: "Yes, Mother."
Walt says: "You told that story at his graduation."
Mom says: "I'm afraid he can't be trusted on this mission."
Mom says: "You see, there is a terrible secret about Igner I've never told anyone."
Mom says: "And here it is."
Cut to a wide shot of them talking. They can't be heard. Igner is sweeping and listening from an open door. Cut back to Mom. She says something and Walt and Larry's jaws drop. Igner makes his "I'm scared" noise. Cut to the Planet Express ship flying toward the mine. It's being fired by a line of Killbots at and returning fire.
Walt says: "Continue returning fire."
Killbot 1 says: "What?"
Killbot 2 says: "What did they say?"
Killbot 1 says: "I don't know."
Killbot 1 says: "I can't hear a thing."
Killbot 3 says: "Hey, what's everybody talking about?"
The ship takes down two Killbots, but the hole is filled by more. It is hit multiple times and the crew starts screaming. Keep exterior shot of the ship.
Farnsworth says: "Mayday!"
Farnsworth says: "Mayday!"
Farnsworth says: "We weren't actually in the ship."
The three are standing in front of exhaust fans.
Leela says: "Okay, team, these red-hot, razor-sharp fans are the only safe way into the mine."
Fry says: "Hmm, uh, ladies first."
<poem>Elevator Steward says: "Maintenance shaft 7 serving..."
Farnsworth says: "Shut your mouth."
Elevator Steward says: "I'm just talking about the shaft."
Leela kicks him in the chest, he hits the wall and falls apart. Her collar is emitting a charge.
Fry says: "Jeez, doesn't that shock collar hurt?"
Leela says: "Actually, feels kind of good."
Leela says: "I guess I'm starting to associate it with the pleasure of beating people up."
The doors on the elevator close and it begins its descent, but picks up speed all the way down. The three of them are screaming and an interior shot of the elevator shows them experiencing weightlessness. An exterior shot of Level 65 shows the elevator suddenly stop a few feet from the floor, slamming the three of them to the ground. It slowly lowers until it's even with the floor. Cut to Mom staring at the crashes ship on her TV.
Walt says: "We shot them down, Mother."
Walt says: "The intruders never even got to Sector 1."
Security Woman says: "Intruders in Sector 15."
Security Woman says: "Intruders in Sector 15."
Mom says: "Ugh..."
Mom says: "Sometimes I don't know why I even bother to slap you."
Mom says: "All Killbots to Sector 15."
Cut to two Killbots rolling down a hallway.
Killbot 1 says: "What did she say?"
<poem>Fry says: "There are so many killbots behind us I can't count them all."
<poem>Fry says: "Three, I think."
Leela runs around a corner, then steps back and grabs Fry as he keeps running into the open. Several Killbots drive down a hallway.
Leela says: "We're trapped."
Farnsworth says: "The main pit must be in here."
Farnsworth says: "I'm detecting vast quantities of Dark Matter."
On the wall, there is a keypad reading CODEX PAD.
Leela says: "Step aside turkey-neck."
Leela says: "I think I know the code."
Farnsworth says: "We're in."
Farnsworth says: "We're in the heart of the mine."
Farnsworth says: "The very source of all Mom's wealth and..."
Leela says: "My God!"
Leela says: "This isn't a crap mine."
Leela says: "It's a crap farm."
Fry says: "Is there really so much of a distinction?"
Fry says: "I mean..."
Nibbler says: "Leela, it's me, Nibbler."
Leela runs over to a Nibblonian, he looks tired and very shaggy.
Leela says: "Oh, my God, you look horrible, Nibbler."
Leela says: "I think I'm going to vomit."
Nibblonian says: "Nibbler is over there."
Leela says: "Oh, sorry."
Leela says: "Nibbler!"
Leela says: "Oh, my poor little snuzzy-wuzzams."
Leela says: "Are they treating you okay?"
Nibbler says: "No, they are force-feeding us so we poop more dark matter."
Nibbler says: "It's horrible."
Nibbler says: "Those are good."
Nibbler says: "You've got to help us."
Nibblonians says: "Help us!"
Nibblonian says: "Help us, for God's sakes!"
Nibbler drops a turd and it is transported out of his cage via a tube. Nibbler whimpers.
Leela says: "Nibbler made a bo-bo."
Nibbler says: "Yes, but not on my terms."
Nibbler says: "I will not be treated like..."
Nibbler says: "Hey, wait, aren't you amazed I can speak?"
Fry says: "Well, actually, no."
Fry says: "You forgot to blank our memories after you spoke last time."
Nibbler says: "You mean you've known I was sentient?"
Nibbler says: "Then why did you let me eat Friskies and make bo-bo in a litter box?"
Fry says: "Well, you're cuter that way."
Farnsworth says: "Cute as a baby's buttocks."
Leela says: "So what happened?"
Leela says: "How did Mom capture all you Nibblonians?"
Nibbler says: "I was Supreme Fuzzler of a Nibblonian scientific outpost."
Nibbler says: "It was paradise, until they came."
Nibbler says: "One of your DOOP ships struck dark matter, little realizing it was not a natural deposit, but rather centuries of Nibblonian fecal material."
Fry says: "Wow, the big fecal enchilada."
Fry says: "Anyone else hungry?"
Nibbler says: "The DOOP contracted a ruthless businesswoman to spearhead the mining operation."
Leela says: "Let me guess."
Leela says: "Mom?"
Nibbler says: "The very same."
Fry says: "Can I also guess Mom?"
Nibbler says: "To reduce cost she started a new enterprise, Mom's Friendly Robots, to build robot slaves."
Nibbler says: "Remember this was back in the days before Robot Lincoln."
Mom says: "Faster, faster!"
Robot Slave says: "I'm going exactly as fast as you built me to go."
Mom says: "Oh, wise guy, huh?"
She unplugs him from the socket and whips him with the cord, then plugs him back in.
Robot Slave says: "Ow!"
Nibbler says: "Eventually, the planet was mined down to a hollow shell and my people were forced to evacuate."
Mom says: "So, that's where it comes from."
Mom says: "We may have a whole new source of Dark Matter on our hands."
Igner says: "Eww!"
Nibbler says: "As it turned out I was the lucky one."
Nibbler says: "Unbeknownst to me, Mom captured my colleagues and enslaved them here in this..."
Nibbler says: "this..."
Nibbler says: "crap farm."
Nibblonian says: "There's nothing to do but eat and crap, eat and crap."
Nibblonian says: "It's like visiting my parents."
Nibbler says: "As for me, I emerged from behind the "bush of many uses" to find I had been left behind."
Nibbler says: "I was doomed, doomed."
Scene from Loves Labours Lost in Space.
Leela says: "Hello, there."
Nibbler says: "Startled, my cuteness reflex kicked in."
Leela says: "I'll call him Nibbler."
Nibbler says: "A silly name for a high-ranking Fuzzler."
Nibbler says: "But, hey, I was glad to be rescued."
<poem>Leela says: "But then, how did you end up here with the others?"
Nibbler says: "I was kidnapped yesterday by Mom's vile sons in their moronic disguises."
Igner says: "I was an owl exterminator."
Igner says: "Do you have the crysal?"
Farnsworth says: "It's pronounced "crystal," you lump."
A noise is heard from the door behind them.
Igner says: "Go, run fast."
<poem>Walt says: "Did you see anyone?"
Igner says: "Me?"
Walt says: "Yes, you."
Walt says: "You're the only one here."
Igner says: "If I'm the only one here, then how could I see anyone?"
Larry says: "He's got a point, Walt."
Walt says: "So does my knee."
Walt hits Larry with his knee. Cut to the three navigating through the chicken shute.
Fry says: "This wouldn't be so bad if it weren't for the chickens."
[Scene says: "Bender is having an robotomy."
[Scene says: "Nurse Ratchet pulls a lever and Bender's arms and legs are restrained."
Nurse Ratchet says: "Don't worry, those clamps are for my own protection."
Dr. Perceptron says: "Do you know where you are, Bender?"
Bender says: "Sure do, I'm in the magical land of Cornwood, frolicking with wenches."
Dr. Perceptron says: "Close."
Dr. Perceptron says: "You're in the loony bin for a robotomy."
Dr. Perceptron says: "I will begin by drilling through the eye to access the frontal processor."
<poem>Nurse Ratchet says: "Can't you just use the access panel?"
Dr. Perceptron says: "Either way is fine."
Bender says: "Does anyone else smell burning dragon beak?"
Cut to Mom's office. Fry, Leela and Farnsworth are in the ventilation ducts above. Leela opens the grated panel and they gasp.
Mom says: "Wherever you are, Farnsworth, my boys will find you."
<poem>Walt says: "They've eluded us, Mother."
<poem>Walt says: "But rest assured, we've already slapped each other, so there's no need to..."
Mom says: "You'll thank me some day when you are slapping your own kids."
Mom says: "I know Farnsworth's game."
Mom says: "He is going to try to poke his clammy old crystal at my hot fiery crystal."
Larry says: "Mom!"
Mom says: "If the crystals get within six inches of each other..."
Mom says: "Wham!"
Mom says: "All my dark matter will be worthless."
She sits back down in her chair and a slipper floats down and lands on her head. She examines it and spots the three of them shuffling along the top of a circular vent. She screams and then Farnsworth screams back.
Mom says: "Get them!"
Her sons try to climb the icey wall to reach them.
Leela says: "Keep going, Professor."
Leela says: "I'll take care of the ditz brothers."
Leela says: "Ooh."
Leela says: "That feels good."
Mom says: "Oh, for crying out..."
Mom says: "Oh, the freaking battery's dead."
Mom says: "Walt, where's the charger?"
Walt says: "In the hardware drawer, Mother."
<poem>Mom says: "Damn tangled mess of wires."
Farnsworth says: "We're almost there."
Farnsworth says: "The crystals are beginning to engorge."
<poem>Mom says: "Nobody move."
<poem>Mom says: "I've found the charger."
<poem>Mom says: "Hang on."
<poem>Mom says: "I'm on it."
<poem>Mom says: "Okay, there!"
Fry says: "Save us, Catman."
Mom says: "It's over, Hubert."
Mom says: "Give me the anti-backwards crystal."
Farnsworth says: "Never!"
<poem>Mom says: "Oh, bravo."
<poem>Mom says: "You're in a crap-harvesting factory, genius."
<poem>Mom says: "Walt!"
<poem>Mom says: "Larry!"
<poem>Mom says: "Start harvesting."
Farsnworth says: "No!"
Cut back to the robotomy.
<poem>Dr. Perceptron says: "I will now delicately jerk out your imagination, severing fantasy's grip on your nerd-circuit."
Bender says: "Cornwood!"
<poem>Dr. Perceptron says: "Illogical."
<poem>Dr. Perceptron says: "Illogical."
<poem>Dr. Perceptron says: "Computational overload."
Nurse Rachet says: "But, Doctor, I love you."
Cut back to Mom. She is still laughing.
<poem>Mom says: "Oh, what now?"
The same purple waves move through the office and the floor begins to crack. Everybody falls into the hole with the ice and scream.
[Scene says: "A green pasture is shown upside down."
[Scene says: "The ground shakes and rocks blast out from underneath."
[Scene says: "The shot rotates 180 degrees and Fry climbs out of the hole."
Frydo says: "This is crazy."
Frydo says: "Ow!"
Frydo says: "What the..."
Frydo says: "You okay, Leela?"
Leegola says: "Yeah, I think so."
Frydo says: "Wait a second."
Frydo says: "Is there something different about your hooves?"
<poem>Leegola says: "Oh, Lord."
<poem>Leegola says: "I'm half-horse and half-naked."
Frydo says: "Where the hell are we, hell?"
A horse is heard neighing and someone approaches them on it.
Frydo says: "Bender?"
Titanius Anglesmith says: "I know not of this Bender."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "I'm Titanius Anglesmith."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Welcome to Cornwood!"
Frydo and Leegola gasp.
[Scene says: "Titanius Anglesmith's Castle."
[Scene says: "A feast is taking place."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Wretched peasants, put aside your cares and feast on the succulent flesh of the roast munchkin!"
Frydo and Leegola both show distaste toward the rotating, crispy munchkin.
Peasent Cook says: "Care for a slice of scroto?"
Frydo says: "Uh..."
Frydo says: "that's his name, right?"
Peasent Cook says: "'Tis also that, sir."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "We're honored this eve by a visit from my friends of old, Frydo and Leegola."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "So let the dwarves do their gay dance and let the gnomes play their sissy piccolos."
<poem>Dwarf says: "My ankle!"
Titanius Anglesmith says: "To the kitchen with him!"
Dwarf says: "Wait!"
Dwarf says: "Wait!"
Dwarf says: "Wait!"
Dwarf says: "I do impressions."
Dwarf says: "Behold!"
Dwarf says: "The swamp hag: "Get out of my swamp, you kids!"
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Don't let him get too crispy."
Calculon says: "Lord Anglesmith."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "You have ridden hard, noble squire."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "May I offer you a horn of ale and a shank of dwarf?"
Calculon says: "'Tis dire news, sire."
Calculon says: "Dark riders approach."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Frydo!"
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Saddle up that trusty steed."
Fry rides Leegola out of the castle and is holding a lance. Titanius Anglesmith is behind them.
Frydo says: "What's happening?"
Frydo says: "And why am I enjoying it so much?"
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Foul beast-bags!"
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Meet thy doom!"
Titanius Anglesmith lodges his lance in the ground and is thrown off his horse, off screen.
Waltazar says: "Follow me."
Frydo rides toward the three sons, but is impaled by Waltazar's lance against a tree. Ignus runs into Waltazar and impales him and Frydo.
Waltazar says: "Damn thee, Ignus."
Ignus says: "Well, you said to follow you."
Waltazar says: "Well, now I say follow this!"
<poem>Larius says: "The Die of Power!"
<poem>Larius says: "He's rolling it."
Waltazar says: "Oh, no!"
Titanius Anglesmith says: "I'm back bab-..."
Die of Power says: "Seven."
Titanius Anglesmith says: ""Banish foes"?"
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Cool."
Waltazar says: "No!"
Waltazar says: "No!"
The three sons disappear from their horses and reappear in a swamp.
Larius says: "I got to say, I had no idea the Die of Power was so powerful."
Waltazar says: "Did you have any idea of..."
Swamp Hag says: "Get out of my swamp, you kids!"
[Scene says: "Titanius Anglesmith, Leegola and the wounded Frydo are riding through a forest."
Leegola says: "I can't believe I'm saying this, but that was really exciting."
Leegola says: "I've never felt so alive."
Leegola says: "What else can we slay?"
Leegola says: "Is that a hobbit over there?"
Titanius Anglesmith says: "No, that's a hobo and a rabbit."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "But they're making a hobbit."
Frydo says: "Thank God, an outhouse."
Frydo says: "I can't hold it in much longer."
Frydo says: "And by it, I mean my entrails."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Hush!"
Titanius Anglesmith says: "This be no outhouse, but the lair of the great wizard Grayfarn."
Titanius Anglesmith knocks on the door.
Greyfarn says: "Who is it?"
<poem>Titanius Anglesmith says: "'Tis I, Titanius."
Greyfarn says: "Just a moment."
<poem>Titanius Anglesmith says: "Methinks the wizard be casting a powerful spell, indeed."
A zipper is heard and the door opens, but the interior has changed from an outhouse to a room with a fireplace.
Greyfarn says: "Come in!"
Greyfarn says: "Come in!"
Greyfarn says: "Yes."
Greyfarn says: "'Tis a powerful object in both our worlds."
Greyfarn says: "If you failed to destroy it in yours, perhaps you were brought here that you might have a second chance."
Frydo says: "So, this land is real?"
Greyfarn says: "Oh, dreadfully real."
Greyfarn says: "If you die here, you'll really be dead."
Greyfarn says: "But instead of science, we believe in crazy hocus-pocus."
Greyfarn says: "It's like Kansas."
Leegola says: "God help us."
Greyfarn says: "Cornwood's troubles began hundreds or perhaps millions of years ago."
Greyfarn says: "Deep in the Geysers of Gygax, Momon herself injection-molded the Dice of Power from the living plastic."
Momon says: "Damn, these are hot."
Leegola says: "Ah ha!"
Leegola says: "In our universe she's called Mom."
Greyfarn says: "In your universe, are you taught not to interrupt?"
Greyfarn says: "Evidently not."
Greyfarn says: "Anyway, Momon spawned three rotten sons, whom you've already had the displeasure of meeting."
Greyfarn says: "Waltazar, Larius, and the dumbest of all, the halfwit Ignus, bastard son of Momon and the brainless He-demon."
Greyfarn says: "Curse you, Momon, queen of all that is evil and not very good in bed."
Greyfarn says: "And I'm not just saying that because she dumped me."
<poem>Titanius Anglesmith says: "Yeah?"
<poem>Titanius Anglesmith says: "Well, bite my shiny metal face."
Greyfarn says: "Don't be foolish, Titanius."
Greyfarn says: "If you had paid attention in freshman alchemy, instead of frequenting the bawdyhouse, you'd know there's only one way to destroy it."
Greyfarn says: "In the boiling plastic from which it was molded."
Frydo says: "Like that machine that makes wax lions at the zoo."
Greyfarn says: "Quiet, you."
Greyfarn says: "We must infiltrate the Geysers of Gygax, the impenetrable stronghold of Momon."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Impossible."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Impossible, I say."
Greyfarn says: "No, Titanius."
Greyfarn says: "For we maintain one advantage, the element of surprise."
[Scene says: "The crew is walking through a light forest."
<poem>Titanius Anglesmith says: "Verily, our quest has begun."
Hermaphrodite says: "Stop right there."
They gasp as he walks out from behind a bush with others. They too are centaurs.
Frydo says: "Hermes?"
Leegola says: "He's a centaur like me."
Frydo says: "You wish."
Hermaphrodite says: "I am Hermaphrodite, most beautiful of centaurs."
Hermaphrodite says: "Gaze upon me and weep at my loveliness."
Greyfarn says: "Very well."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Loveliest of centaurs, we seek to end Momon's reign of evil."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Have you stout fighters at your command?"
Hermaphrodite says: "One thousand archers of truest aim."
Hermaphrodite says: "Fire!"
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Hey guys, I forgot I had this pumpkin."
<poem>Leegola says: "I knew it."
<poem>Leegola says: "My people are mighty warriors."
<poem>Leegola says: "Our enemies will be like Swiss cheese with blood coming out of the holes."
The centaurs object.
Female Centaur says: "We centaurs are creatures of peace."
Leegola says: "Oh, Lord."
Hermaphrodite says: "Violence is never justified."
Hermaphrodite says: "We shall not join your quest."
Hermaphrodite says: "And furthermore, if mayhem be your intent, you may not cross our lands."
Leegola says: "Or what?"
Hermaphrodite says: "You may pass."
[Scene says: "The crew is trying to find their way to Momon, but are having difficulties."
[Scene says: "They travel over a large wooden bridge."
[Scene says: "Cut to them looking over a map while standing on a cliff in the snow."
Greyfarn says: "We're not there, we're here."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "No, this way."
Greyfarn says: "I mean, here."
They walk back over the bridge they first crossed. Cut to them standing on the shoulders of a tree that is walking over a large body of water. He then sets them down on land.
Greyfarn says: "Thank you, kindly, Treedledum."
Treedledum says: "Okey-doke."
Treedledum says: "Anything else I can do?"
Cut to the crew around a fire that is burning Treedledum.
Leegola says: "You know who I'm gonna miss?"
Leegola says: "That tree guy."
It's now daytime and there are many camps positioned along the visible path to Momon.
Greyfarn says: "Bad news, fancy men."
Greyfarn says: "Momon's guards stand watch at the pass."
Greyfarn says: "'Tis as if she somehow anticipated us."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "And so our quest comes to an end."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "I only regret not giving up sooner."
Greyfarn says: "Fret not, Titanius."
Greyfarn says: "For we still have one hope, the Cave of Hopelessness."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Let me know how that turns out."
[Scene says: "The foursome are walking toward the entrance of the Cave of Hopelessness."
[Scene says: "There is a large ogre acting as a bouncer."
Ogre says: "Halt."
Ogre says: "Are you on the list?"
Ogre says: "I'm not seeing you on the list."
Leegola says: "I'll split this doofus in half."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Wait, I got it."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Yeah."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "My cousin's in the band."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "The band of merry men."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Please, we were already in there."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "I just need to go back for my coat."
The water behind them begins bubbling. An aquatic version of Amy rises from the water. Frydo gasps.
Gynecaladriel says: "I am Gynecaladriel, queen of the water nymphos."
Leegola says: "All right."
Leegola says: "I'll split this doofus in half."
Gynecaladriel says: "Stand aside and I will use my powers to overwhelm the guard."
Gynecaladriel says: "Behold, the deed is done."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Hi oh!"
Cut to them walking through the cave holding torches.
Frydo says: "Mr."
Frydo says: "Wizard, why is this place called the Cave of Hopelessness?"
Greyfarn says: "Oh, fear not, lad."
Greyfarn says: "'Tis named for its discoverer, Reginald Hopelessness..."
Frydo says: "Whew!"
Greyfarn says: "..."
Greyfarn says: "the first man to be eaten alive by the Tunneling Horror."
They stop as shadows appear on the wall of the curve ahead of them.
Frydo says: "What's that?"
Frydo says: "The Tunneling Horror?"
Gynecaladriel says: "No, it's morcs."
Morcs says: "Hey, listen."
Morcs says: "Nanu, nanu."
Morcs says: "Shazbot."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Oh, God, no."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "They're so aggravating."
The morcs speak really quickly while being slaughtered by the crew.
Morcs says: "Oh, fantastic."
Morcs says: "Nanu, nanu."
Morcs says: "Reality, what a concept."
Morcs says: "Fantastic."
Morcs says: "Mindy, Mindy, Mindy."
Gynecaladriel says: "Shut up!"
Gynecaladriel says: "Shut up!"
Morcs says: "Oh, fantastic."
Morcs says: "Oh, fantastic."
Morcs says: "Oh, wonderful."
Frydo says: "Maybe it'll go away if we just don't laugh at it."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "It doesn't."
Cut to the team backing out of the tunnel and into a large area of the cave. Leegola is killing the remaining morcs in the tunnel.
Morcs says: "Nanu, nanu."
<poem>Frydo says: "Well, at least we didn't have to face the tunneling whatchimacallit."
<poem>Frydo says: "Uh-oh."
Zoidberg's head pokes out from behind a wall.
Zoidberg says: "Enough already with the banging and the swashbuckling."
He crawls over the wall to reveal he's a large, centepede-esque creature. Everybody screams as he stand in front of them.
Leegola says: "Oh, I'm gonna enjoy killing you."
<poem>Zoidberg says: "Watch where you're shooting that thing."
<poem>Zoidberg says: "Again?"
<poem>Zoidberg says: "What, am I talking to myself over here?"
Leegola says: "Mutilate!"
<poem>Zoidberg says: "Okay."
<poem>Zoidberg says: "Now, I'm getting a little mad even."
He makes noises as he snatches up the five of them with his claws. Leegola gets loose.
Leegola says: "I'll kill you and eat your heart, you abomination."
Frydo says: "Leela, it's over."
Frydo says: "You killed him enough."
Leegola says: "I'm not taking any chances with the Tunneling Horror."
Zoidberg says: "What?"
Zoidberg says: "I'm not the Tunneling Horror."
Zoidberg says: "I hate that guy."
Zoidberg says: "Always with the tunneling."
Zoidberg says: "Anyway, I'm dead."
<poem>Leegola says: "So, you're just an innocent monster."
<poem>Leegola says: "Oh, God."
<poem>Leegola says: "What have I done?"
The cave starts rumbling.
Zoidberg says: "Oh!"
Zoidberg says: "There he goes again."
A large, killer worm creature comes out of the ground and roars at Leegola and Frydo, who are standing on Zoidberg. Everybody screams.
Titanius Anglesmith says: "The Tunneling Horror!"
<poem>Frydo says: "Greyfarn, what do we do?"
Greyfarn says: "Do about what?"
The Tunneling Horror lunges at Frydo and Leegola, but misses and grabs Titanius Anglesmith with its tail pincers.
Frydo says: "Why aren't you killing it, Leela?"
Frydo says: "You love killing."
Leegola says: "No, no more killing."
Zoidberg says: "Oh!"
Zoidberg says: "So, suddenly, Miss Goody Four-shoes over here doesn't kill anymore."
Zoidberg says: "She killed me not five minutes ago."
Zoidberg says: "What am I?"
Zoidberg says: "Chopped liver?"
Leegola says: "Shut up."
<poem>Zoidberg says: "Ow!"
<poem>Zoidberg says: "Stop chopping my liver."
Leegola says: "You're on your own."
<poem>Frydo says: "All right."
<poem>Frydo says: "I may be weak and I may be small, but I don't see how I can possibly destroy that monster."
<poem>Frydo says: "Guess I'll just huck whatever's in my pockets at him."
<poem>Frydo says: "At least I can say I tried."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Any time now."
Frydo throws a box of Tic-Tacs, a peanut and then the Die of Power.
Frydo says: "The Die of Power."
Frydo says: "I forgot to remember to roll it."
[Everybody turns to the die says: "grow."
gasps. Gynecaladriel says: "grow."
Greyfarn stop kissing says: "grow."
Gynecaladriel places Greyfarn's dentures back in his mouth. The die lands on three says: "grow."
Die of Power says: "Three."
Frydo says: ""Grow?"
Frydo says: "" I don't see anything growing."
Frydo says: "Everything is getting smaller."
Frydo says: "Wow, that was intense."
Frydo says: "You guys got to try the Die of Power."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "I'll take a hit."
Frydo says: "Hands off the dodecalicious."
<poem>Greyfarn says: "Beware, Frydo."
<poem>Greyfarn says: "Don't be seduced."
<poem>Greyfarn says: "Hang on a second."
<poem>Greyfarn says: "Resist the allure of the die."
<poem>Greyfarn says: "For to defeat Momon, we must melt it in the super bombastic, bubbling plastic from whence it came."
Greyfarn says: "For to defeat Momon, we must melt it in the super bombastic, bubbling plastic from whence it came."
Momon is speaking to her sons.
Momon says: "I send you to kill them and they're not even maimed?"
Momon says: "That's what I get for sending boys to do a mom's job."
Larius says: "Sorry, Mom."
Momon says: "Sorry doesn't put heads on my table."
Momon says: "Peaches."
Momon says: "You're up."
Peaches grabs a flail that has a hand instead of a spiked ball. He whirls is around in front of the sons.
Ignus says: "I like this part but I don't like..."
They are slapped three times by the hand.
[Scene says: "Hermaphrodite and another centaur are walking in a circle in the middle of a stadium."
Centaur Opponent says: "You are an able opponent, Hermaphrodite."
Centaur Opponent says: "But hear me well when I posit that we must abhor violence in all its forms."
The crowd cheers.
Hermaphrodite says: "I offer a dissenting opinion."
<poem>Hermaphrodite says: "For abhorring violence is itself an act of violence and, therefore, to be abhorred."
<poem>Hermaphrodite says: "Ah!"
<poem>Hermaphrodite says: "Don't hurt me."
Leegola says: "I'm not here to hurt you."
Leegola says: "Or anything ever again."
Leegola says: "Please, teach me the centaurs' ways of wimpiness."
Hermaphrodite says: "What do you offer in return?"
Leegola holds up a carrot, which Hermaphrodite eats. Cut to the two galloping along a path, a rainbow is in the background. They run past creatures which resemble Teletubbies. Cut to the two shooting flaming arrows toward each other. The arrows collide and form a firework in the shape of a peace sign. Cut to the two and another centaur playing tic-tac-toe with beanbags. Hermaphrodite misses winning the game, Leegola walks up with a beanbag in her mouth and drops it on the winning tile. They all laugh.
[Scene says: "Titanius Anglesmith, Frydo, Greyfarn and Gynecaladriel exit the Cave of Hopelessness."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Yes!"
Titanius Anglesmith says: "We made it out of that godforsaken cave."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Now, what's the fastest way home?"
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Back through the cave?"
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Ow!"
Exterior shot of the Geysers of Gygax.
Greyfarn says: "We're close now, my friends."
Greyfarn says: "So close, I can practically feel the heat of the fiery molten plastic."
Gynecaladriel says: "You're standing in the fire."
Greyfarn says: "Oh, my."
Greyfarn says: "Alas, our path is blocked by Momon's army of evil."
Greyfarn says: "As well as her navy of moral dubiousness."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Wait a second."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Mayhaps we might raise an army of our own."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "We're but an hour's ride from Wipe Castle."
Greyfarn says: "Of course."
Greyfarn says: "Wipe Castle."
Greyfarn says: "And while we're there, we can get some of those greasy little dwarf burgers."
Gynecaladriel says: "Ooh!"
Gynecaladriel says: "I love those."
Gynecaladriel says: "You can eat like eight of them without gaining any weight because of all the diarrhea."
Greyfarn says: "Sleep deep, fair snoozles."
Greyfarn says: "At dawn, we ride for Wipe Castle."
Momon is watching from the die.
<poem>Momon says: "We've got them now."
<poem>Momon says: "Send all our forces against Wipe Castle."
Waltazar says: "Right away, Mother."
Waltazar says: "I'll just leave a small contingent behind in case..."
Momon says: "I said, everything."
Momon says: "Peaches!"
Peaches says: "I'm in the tub."
Momon says: "Waltazar, you and Larius shall lead the assault."
Waltazar says: "What about Ignus?"
Momon says: "I'm afraid he can't be trusted on this mission."
Momon says: "You see, there is a terrible secret about Ignus I've never told anyone."
Momon says: "And here it is."
Her words cannot be heard as we see Ignus listening from the doorway while sweeping. The two sons in the room are shocked at what Momon says and Ignus gasps.
Momon says: "It's a good day to be evil."
[Scene says: "Frydo ventures away from the camp to some rocks by the water."
<poem>Frydo says: "They all wants it."
<poem>Frydo says: "They wants the dodecalicious."
Frydo's reflection in the water begins speaking to him.
Reflection Host says: "Tell you what, you want to defend a magic artifact, and I mean, defend it good, then what you need is a top-quality knife."
Frydo says: "Me is listening."
The reflection has a Infomercial graphic on it.
Reflection Host says: "The Eviscerator is one of the finest, if not the finest, tactical folder on the market today."
Reflection Host says: "We're talking 440 stainless, quick release and..."
Reflection Host says: "I don't believe this."
Reflection Host says: "Is this a stag horn handle at this price?"
Reflection Host 2 says: "It is, yeah."
Reflection Host 2 says: "It's a stag horn."
Reflection Host says: "At this price?"
Reflection Host says: "You have got to be kidding me."
Reflection Host says: "That's got to be some kind of mistake, right there."
Reflection Host 2 says: "Now, you folks at home, I know what you're thinking."
Reflection Host 2 says: "You're thinking, that can't be stag horn."
Reflection Host 2 says: "It's got to be the cheaper manticore horn."
Reflection Host 2 says: "But, I've got the specs right here and I'll tell you what, this is the real deal."
Reflection Host says: "Unbelievable."
Reflection Host 2 says: "It is unbelievable."
Reflection Host 2 says: "That's exactly what it is."
Reflection Host 2 says: "I mean, this is..."
Reflection Host 2 says: "I have no words to describe this deal."
Reflection Host 2 says: "Honestly, have you ever seen stag horn at this price?"
Cut to Frydo, he shakes his head.
Reflection Host says: "No, no, I don't believe I ever have."
Reflection Host 2 says: "1101-1816 is the item number on this one."
Reflection Host says: "You know what, we're gonna have to  put a clock on this deal, folks."
Reflection Host says: "Two minutes."
Reflection Host says: "Can I get a clock at two minutes up there?"
Reflection Host 2 says: "Two minutes at most."
Reflection Host 2 says: "Honestly, I'd be surprised if they last that long."
Reflection Host says: "Oh, I'd be very surprised, shocked really."
Reflection Host says: "Now, I know the lines are busy, people, but keep dialing in if you want a truly exceptional knife to slice up your friends in their sleep."
Cut to Frydo walking with the knife in his hand. He's flicking it open and closed repeatedly. He walks over to Titanius Anglesmith's sleeping bag and begins stabbing it. Titanius Anglesmith is in Gynecaladriel's sleeping bag, however. They both wake up and gasp.
Titanius Anglesmith says: "He tried to murder me."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "He tried..."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Woah, cool."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "Is that the stag horn?"
Frydo hisses at Titanius and throws the knife at him. The handle and blade break away from each other and Frydo runs away from the camp.
[Scene says: "Titanius Anglesmith, Greyfarn and Gynecaladriel are venturing toward Wipe Castle."
Greyfarn says: "Alas, Frydo's weakness was no match for the die's strength."
Greyfarn says: "We can only hope he forges on alone to the Geysers."
Titanius Anglesmith says: "I can hope my ass is made of ice-cream but that don't make me a hot fudge sundae."
Greyfarn says: "As for us, we must press on to Wipe Castle, though the journey be long and I fear I may not live to see it."
Gynecaladriel says: "There it is!"

Titanius Anglesmith says: "Methinks we be boned."
Larius says: "Where's their army?"
Waltazar says: "Maybe they didn't hear the horn."
Waltazar says: "Blow it again."
