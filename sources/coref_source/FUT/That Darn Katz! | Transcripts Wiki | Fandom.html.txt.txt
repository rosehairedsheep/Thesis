Announcer says: "Ribs, skulls, spines, even certain tiny ear bones."
Announcer says: "The leg bone's connected to the Cash Bone!"
[Scene says: "Planet Express, Lounge."
[Scene says: "Nibbler is burying Dark Matter in his litter box."
Leela says: "Aw!"
Leela says: "Nibbler made a bobo for Mamma."
Leela says: "I'll pick it up with my super-dupey poopy scoopy."

Amy says: "Core magnetic field, 31 microteslas."
Prof. Farnsworth says: "Nice."
Amy says: "Temperature?"
Amy says: "Woah!"
Amy says: "The magma P."
Amy says: "I."
Amy says: "is 10,000 degrees Selleck!"
Amy says: "Leela, I am collecting data."
Amy says: "Can't you dump that somewhere else?"
Leela says: "Not really."
Leela says: "It's highly volatile Dark Matter, and some corn."
Amy says: "But I'm presenting my thesis tomorrow and I've barely had time to prepare."
Farnsworth says: "Nonsense."
Farnsworth says: "You've been my grad student for twelve years."
Farnsworth says: "You were ready six years ago."
Amy says: "What?"
Farnsworth says: "I probably should have told you."
Farnsworth says: "Anyway, the important thing is to be relaxed tomorrow."
Amy says: "Are you sure?"
Farnsworth says: "Yes."
Farnsworth says: "Do what you young people do to unwind."
Farnsworth says: "Take a joyride in your jalopy."
Farnsworth says: "Wear a T-shirt and eat a fish stick."
Farnsworth says: "Go!"
[Scene says: "The Hip Joint."
[Scene says: "Fry, Leela, Bender, Nibbler, Amy and Kif are sitting at a table."
Kif says: "Okay, amigos, one teensy drink to help Amy relax."
Amy says: "Hmmm."
Amy says: "I guess I'm still kinda nervous."
Leela says: "One more teensy drink to help Amy relax."
Fry says: "Still a little nervous?"
Bender says: "She's a nervous wreck!"
[Time Lapse says: "Bender, Fry, Kif and Amy are all dancing."
[Time Lapse says: "They are clearly drunk."
[Time Lapse says: "Kif is still drinking."
Nibbler says: "Leela, it's time you and I had a talk."
Leela says: "A talk?"
Leela says: "You can't break up with me."
Leela says: "You're my pet!"
Nibbler says: "As much as I enjoy being the object of your misplaced affections, I am also a highly sophisticated being who longs for intelligent conversation."
Leela says: "Aw, is shnookums not feeling schtimuwated?"
Nibbler says: "An understatement, to say the least."
Nibbler says: "It's time you treated me with respect."
Leela says: "If you want to be treated like a fellow crew member, fine, but no more purse rides, and no more dressing you up in your cute little sailor suit."
Nibbler says: "I keep telling you, that's my real naval uniform."
[Time Lapse says: "Kif and Amy are still dancing."
[Time Lapse says: "They kiss."
Kif says: "Your place or mine?"
Amy says: "Both, but first, this place."
[Scene says: "Amy's apartment."
[Scene says: "Her Alarm Clock goes off."
[Scene says: "It reads 8:50."
Amy says: "I thought I set you for 7:15!"
Alarm Clock says: "Sorry, I hooked up with Bender last night."
Alarm Clock says: "Dude was all over my snooze button."
Amy says: "But my doctoral exam is in ten minutes!"
Amy says: "On Mars!"
Amy says: "Eww!"
Amy says: "Kif, did you yack on the floor?"
Kif says: "Yes, I did."
[Scene says: "Mars University."

Morris Katz says: "Where's your candidate, Farnsworth."
Morris Katz says: "I have a long list of students to humiliate today."
Morris Katz says: "You're late, Miss Wong."
Amy says: "Oh, God, this is like one of those nightmares."
Farnsworth says: "Here, take my lab coat."
Katz says: "Allow me to introduce your examining committee in descending  order of grumpiness."
Katz says: "Professor Ogden Wernstrom."
Farsnworth says: "Wernstrom!"
Katz says: "Downtown Professor of Applied Physics, Ethan 'Bubblegum' Tate."
Tate says: "I see by your curriculum vit√¶ that you're a Sagittarius."
Katz says: "And Professor Fisherprice Shpeekenshpell."
Shpeekenshpell says: "The cow says..."
Shpeekenshpell says: "Moo."
Farnsworth says: "He proved that 50 years ago, and he's been coasting on it ever since."
Katz says: "I am the esteemed Professor Morris Katz, and you are wasting my time."
Katz says: "Proceed."
Amy says: "Imagine, if you will..."
Katz says: "Oh, God!"
Amy says: "A gigantic spherical generator, one that could provide unlimited energy, because it's essentially in Perpetual Motion."
Wermstrom says: "Young lady, have you been drinking?"
Amy says: "Well, yes, but that's not revelant."
Amy says: "I'm talking about Earth."
Amy says: "Earth's the generator."
Amy says: "Suppose this basketball is the whole world."
Tate says: "To many young men in the inner city, it is."
Amy says: "As it spins, it's producing an enormous magnetic field."
Amy says: "If we could use that field to generate electric current, we could actually harness the Earth's rotational ener..."
Amy says: "Ener..."
Farnsworth says: "Yes, tapping the Earth's ener-kerchoo."
Farnsworth says: "Go on."
Amy says: "Sorry, I'm super-allergic to cats."
Amy says: "Professor Katz, would you mind."
Katz says: "Miss Wong, I mind everything."
Amy says: "Sorry."
Katz says: "Enough."
Katz says: "The committee members will now vote yea or nay."
Katz says: "Nay."
Wernstrom says: "Nay."
Tate says: "Hell nay."
Shpeekenshpell says: "The horse says, doctorate denied."
[Scene says: "Planet Express."
[Scene says: "Waterfront."
[Scene says: "The ship flies in for a landing."
Everyone gets off the ship. Amy is still in the Professor's coat.
Fry says: "It's okay, Amy."
Fry says: "I don't have a fancy degree either, but today I'm a prominent boy in the package delivery field."
[Scene says: "Planet Express."
[Scene says: "Meeting Room."
[Scene says: "The entire crew, plus Nibbler, are seated at the table."
Nibbler says: "Now that I'm a full and equal member of the crew, I pledge my loyalty, my perspicacity, and, dare I say it, my friendship."
Hermes says: "Leela, muzzle that skunk!"
Hermes says: "We can't stop a meeting for some cute, fuzzy, little..."
Hermes says: "Hey, look, a kitty cat."
Amy says: "Get away you mangy ball of Histamines."
Farnsworth says: "People, please, I'm trying to run a business, so I get to hold kitty."
Fry says: "Over here."
Fry says: "I wanna hold him."
Bender says: "Aw!"
Bender says: "Its anus looks like an asterisk."
[Scene says: "Planet Express."

[Scene says: "Everyone except Amy and Nibbler is still playing with the cat."
[Scene says: "It is in Nibber's naval uniform."
Leela says: "Captain Fuzzytoes reporting for duty."
Leela says: "I mean, cutie."
Nibbler says: "My best friend died in that uniform."
Nibbler says: "I hate that cat!"
Amy says: "If I had a spray bottle, I'd give him such a spritzing."
Nibbler says: "I'll tell you one thing."
Nibbler says: "Nothing acts that cute without some ulterior motive."
Amy says: "Aw!"
Amy says: "You want your diapey changed?"
Nibbler says: "Powder, please."
A montage plays where Amy and Nibbler watch the cat. They use jet packs to watch it on the 2nd floor window. They lay a trap, putting milk in a cage for it, which Zoidberg quickly moves into. They watch Leela walking the cat in a stroller as the montage ends.
Amy says: "Here's my new theory."
Amy says: "That is one adorable cat."
Nibbler says: "I guess I was just jealous."
Nibbler says: "I do miss being Leela's schnookums."
Nibbler says: "I'm going to apologize and hope for a pity pet."
[Scene says: "Planet Express."
[Scene says: "Nighttime."
The cat meows the Meow Mix jingle. A cat shaped flying saucer descends and echos the jingle in a deep tone. The windows shatter.
Amy says: "The cat is evil!"
Amy says: "We have proof!"
Nibbler says: "It was summoning a saucer!"
Farnsworth says: "Of course it wanted a saucer, you idiot."
Farnsworth says: "A saucer of dewicious cweam."
Nibbler says: "You fool, this isn't about the cream."
Bender says: "It's pwonounced "cweam"."
Zoidberg says: "I'm petting mine down to the bone."
Fry says: "Just stwoke its fwffy fur."
Hermes says: "Scwatch its fwubby chin."
Bender says: "Fweeble its fwooby pwow."
They all have cats. They hold them out chanting, "Pet it!".
Amy says: "No, no!"
[Scene says: "Planet Express."
[Scene says: "Morning."
[Scene says: "A cat shaped saucer lands in the hangar."
[Scene says: "The hypnotized crew are unloading boxes, chemicals and a massive ball of yarn."
Nibbler says: "What do cats need with that much yarn and cobalt?"
Amy says: "They're doing something downstairs."
Amy says: "We've got to find out what."
Bender says: "Where do you think you're going, no-cat?"
Amy says: "Uh, the basement."
Amy says: "I think I left the air hockey table on."
Bender says: "Without a cat, you ain't going nowhere."
Nibbler says: "Can you at least tell us what's going on down there?"
Farnsworth says: "We're certainly not building something sinister, if that's what your implying."
Farnsworth says: "Now, come on, Bender."
Farnsworth says: "Something sinister won't build itself."
[Scene says: "NNY."
Amy says: "Professor Katz's last name is Katz."
Amy says: "Do you think he has something to do with these cats?"
Nibbler says: "The conclusion is an inescapable as it is moronic."
[Scene says: "Mars University."
[Scene says: "Physics Dept."
[Scene says: "The department is two buildings on a lever and fulcrum."
[Scene says: "Nibbler's ship lands outside the main building of the Physics Department."
[Scene says: "The weight change causes the Annex to rise into the air."
[Scene says: "Mars University."
[Scene says: "Outside Katz's office."
[Scene says: "The door reads Prof."
[Scene says: "Morris Katz."
[Scene says: "A taped on piece of paper reads, "Please Leave Before Entering"."
Nibbler says: "I warn you, if I have to get cute, it's gonna get ugly."
Amy says: "He's dead!"
Nibbler says: "Wait."
Nibbler says: "What are these strings on his lap?"
Nibbler says: "What the..."
Nibbler says: "He isn't dead."
Nibbler says: "He's one of those dog-operated puppets that's been adapted for use by a cat!"
Amy says: "So I had my doctorate denied by that fuzzball?"
Amy says: "Bad kitty!"
[Scene says: "NNY."
[Scene says: "Nibbler's ship lands."
[Scene says: "Planet Express."
[Scene says: "Hangar."
[Scene says: "Amy and Nibbler sneak to the basement door."
[Scene says: "It reads "Basement stairs."
[Scene says: "Watch for slinkys"."
[Scene says: "She opens in and they run downstairs."
Amy says: "They actually built the planetary ratchet from my thesis!"
Amy says: "Uh-oh."
Nibbler says: "What the..."
Thubanian Leader says: "Well, look what the me dragged in."
Nibbler says: "You can talk!"
Thubanian Leader says: "You can talk?"
Nibbler says: "How ironic."
Nibbler says: "Two hyper-intelligent beings both pretending to be simple house pets!"
Thubanian Leader says: "Say, do you know Obliteron?"
Thubanian Leader says: "He pretends to be a hamster, but..."
Amy says: "Yeah, that's really great."
Amy says: "Could you please tell us what's going on?"
Thubanian Leader says: "What?"
Thubanian Leader says: "Oh, right!"
Thubanian Leader says: "You see, my associates and I are from the ninth planet of the star you call Thuban."
Thubanian Leader says: "Long ago, life there was ideal."
Nibbler says: "Earth!"
Thubanian Leader says: "Indubitably."
Thubanian Leader says: "Although we call it Blue Blue Shiny Ball."
Amy says: "The Great Pyramid at Giza!"
Thubanian Leader says: "Yes."
Thubanian Leader says: "The Egyptians viewed us as gods, but ironically that was our downfall."
Thubanian Leader says: "But the technology to save our planet was lost."
Thubanian Leader says: "Lost, that is, until I heard you speak at Mars University."
Amy says: "So you called my thesis a fat sack of barf, and then you stole it?"
Thubanian Leader says: "Welcome to Academia."
Nibbler says: "He intends to siphon off Earth's rotational energy!"
Amy says: "Earth will come to a stop, and..."
Thubanian Leader says: "Half of you will cook, and half of you will freeze."
Thubanian Leader says: "Earth will be one big McDLT."
Thubanian Leader says: "We just got that commercial last year."
Amy says: "Oh, yeah, smarty paws?"
Amy says: "You may have built the ratchet but you can't reach the core without 4,000 miles of superconducting wire."
Thubanian Leader says: "Quite."
Nibbler says: "Even so, you'd still need a tremendously powerful static charge to trigger the process."
Thubanian Leader says: "Ever had a cat rub up against you?"
Nibbler says: "If you're propositioning me, I'm not interested."
Thubanian Leader says: "I'm talking about the charge generated when 50,000 felines rub against a single surface."
Thubanian Leader says: "Professor?"
The Professor stops turning the machine and activates a can opener in the kitchen. The sound is magnified by speaker system. All over the city, cats hear it and run to Planet Express. They rub against the outer walls, creating a static charge. The machine starts and the Earth can be seen slowing.
Thubanian Leader says: "Soon the world will come to a stop, and there's nothing you can do to stop it."
Thubanian Leader says: "The stopping of the world, that is."
Thubanian Leader says: "It's unstoppable."
Time Lapse.
Thubanian Leader says: "The Earth is coming to a stop."
Thubanian Leader says: "Keep your eyes on the kitties and push!"
Leela says: "Nibbler?"
Leela says: "Poopsie-doodle?"
Thubanian Leader says: "Mr."
Thubanian Leader says: "Winkles, Smudge-Smudge."
Thubanian Leader says: "Quick, dance with each other."
Zoidberg and Bender's cats start dancing together. The crew coos and resumes operating the ratchet.
Nibbler says: "Aw!"
Nibbler says: "Damn, they are good."
The building starts shaking.
Thubanian Leader says: "We're coming to a full stop."
Thubanian Leader says: "All cats, to your posts!"
The cats jump onto scratching posts. The Earth stops.

Calculon says: "Cue disaster effects, and action!"
Calculon says: "Cut!"
Calculon says: "That extra looked at the camera."
Calculon says: "We'll have to do it again."
[Scene says: "Planet Express."
[Scene says: "The crew are thrown against a wall, the cats barely hold onto their posts."
[Scene says: "The pet carrier breaks."
Thubanian Leader says: "And now to transfer your planet's rotational energy to my home world."
[Scene says: "Thuban 9."
[Scene says: "The rotational energy hits a pyramid."
[Scene says: "Planet Express."
[Scene says: "Basement."
Hermes says: "What's all this cat hair on my sweater?"
Bender says: "And why am I full of sand?"
Bender says: "And Tootsie Rolls?"
Nibbler says: "You were all under the spell of those obnoxious space cats."
[Scene says: "Space."
[Scene says: "The Earth is cooked by the Sun."
Farnsworth says: "Quickly!"
Farnsworth says: "If we turn the ratchet the other way, perhaps we can restart the Earth."
Hermes says: "It won't turn."
Hermes says: "Push harder, Bender!"
Bender says: "I can't."
Bender says: "You should have called my cousin, Turner."
[Scene says: "Planet Express."
[Scene says: "Lounge."
[Scene says: "The crew are all trying to keep cool."
Amy says: "It's hopeless."
Amy says: "Even in theory the device can only apply force in one direction."
Fry says: "Can someone open a window?"
Fry says: "It's getting a little warm in here."
Bender says: "Is that better?"
[Scene says: "NNY."
[Scene says: "The city is burning."
On a sidewalk, Gus fries an egg, only to be turned over like an egg by Horrible Gelatinous Blob.
[Scene says: "Planet Express."
[Scene says: "Lounge."
Amy says: "Shmezzus, it's hot!"
Amy says: "Why'd I have to invent that awful device?"
Farnsworth says: "Amy, technology isn't intrinsically good or evil."
Farnsworth says: "It's how it's used."
Farnsworth says: "Like the death ray."
Amy says: "Maybe you're right."
Amy says: "I guess that science has to keep pushing forward with the hope that..."
Amy says: "That's it!"
Amy says: "Pushing forward!"
Amy says: "Professor, I know how to restart the Earth."
Farnsworth says: "That's it."
Farnsworth says: "I'll assemble your committee!"
[Scene says: "Planet Express."
[Scene says: "Meeting Room."
[Scene says: "The crew and Amy's doctoral committee are looking at a hologram of the Earth."
Amy says: "The ratchet won't turn backwards, but what if we kept pushing it forward?"
Amy says: "Earth would start turning again."
Wernstrom says: "Yes, the wrong direction!"
Amy says: "So?"
Tate says: "Gentlemen,  let's get this globe trotting."
[Scene says: "Planet Express."
[Scene says: "Basement."
[Scene says: "Everyone is turning the ratchet."
Amy says: "It's working!"
Amy says: "Just a little faster!"
Zoidberg says: "But we're plotzing here!"
Amy says: "Then look at Nibbler!"
Energy is leaving from the frozen pyramid of Thuban 9.
[Scene says: "Thuban 9."
The energy returns to Earth and the planet resumes spinning. People cheer.
[Scene says: "Mars University."
Farnsworth says: "And though the world is now spinning in the wrong direction, it's good enough."
Farnsworth says: "Well done, Amy."
Wernstrom says: "I'm honored to begrudgingly present you with your Ph."
Wernstrom says: "D."
Wernstrom says: "in applied physics."
Tate says: "Also, some kind of sportsmanship award I had in my glove compartment."
Amy says: "Yay!"
Amy says: "I'm finally done with school."
Amy says: "How's the job market?"
Shpeekenshpell says: "Ruff!"
Farnsworth says: "Congratulations, Dr."
Farnsworth says: "Wong!"
Everyone cheers and applauds.
Kif says: "Congratulations."
Nibbler says: "Permission to come aboard?"
Leela says: "Granted, schnookums."
[Scene says: "Planet Express."
[Scene says: "Waterfront."
Farnsworth says: "You've got a bright future, Amy."
Farnsworth says: "As sure as the Sun sets in the east."
