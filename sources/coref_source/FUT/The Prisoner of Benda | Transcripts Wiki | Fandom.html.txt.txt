[Scene says: "Planet Express, Lounge."
[Scene says: "Leela is looking at herself in a hand-held mirror."
Leela says: "Boy, that thing's big."
Leela says: "Fry, is my colossal eye too big?"
The rest of the crew is watching TV.
Fry says: "No, it's what makes you you."
Leela says: "But it's so round, so hideously round."
Fry says: "Leela, listen."
Fry says: "You're the most beautiful woman I've ever known."
Leela says: "Oh."
Leela says: "So you only care about my looks?"
Fry says: "No, I..."
Fry says: "."
Fry says: "What?"
Linda says: "Finally, New New York got a blast of class today as Nikolai, playboy ruler of the Robo-Hungarian Empire, arrived aboard his extravagant, caviar-powered yacht."
Nikolai says: "I'm just a humble emperor, with a big, big crown!"
Bender says: "Of course I'm not planning to steal that crown!"
Leela says: "What?"
Bender says: "True."
Bender says: "I've always dreamt of being an emperor."
Bender says: "You know, for Halloween, and then forever."
Bender says: "But heisting those jewels would be difficult."
Leela says: "You'd be stupid to try."
Bender says: "I'll need accomplices."
Bender says: "A sexy vamp to distract and tie up the guard."
Amy says: "Never!"
Bender says: "A claw man to slip past the metal detector and cut the alarm wires."
Zoidberg says: "Sorry, I'm set for life after that last job."
Bender says: "And finally, a chump, to be caught on video and later arrested."
Fry says: "As I told you on Sucker-Punch Day, I'm through being a chump."
Bender says: "Of course, it would all require split-second robotic timing."
Bender says: "That's were I come in."
Bender says: "You see, I own a watch."
[Scene says: "Planet Express, The Professor's lab."
[Scene says: "Amy and Prof."
[Scene says: "Farnsworth are cleaning a machine."
Farnsworth says: "There."
Farnsworth says: "This time I'm sure I've fixed the mind-switcher."
Amy says: "Good, I'm sick of cleaning up those heaps of dead monkeys."
Amy says: "But why would you want your mind in a new body?"
Farnsworth says: "Well, as a man enters his 18th decade, he thinks back on the mistakes he's made in life."
Amy says: "Like the heaps of dead monkeys?"
Farnsworth says: "Science cannot move forward without heaps!"
Farnsworth says: "No, what I regret is the youth I wasted playing it safe."
Amy says: "I wasted my youth porking out."
Farnsworth says: "Yes, I remember."
Amy says: "Would you please take that down?"
Amy says: "It's making me hungry."
Farnsworth says: "Funny, I could use a little extra meat on my bones."
Farnsworth says: "Wait a second, if we switch bodies, I could live life to the extreme, and you could indulge your demonic food lust."
Amy says: "Wait, can I still change my mind?"
Farnsworth says: "Let's find out."
Farnsworth says: "I'm sorry, Amy, but your body is not up to the task."
Farnsworth says: "Also, I don't care for these boobs flapping every which way."
Farnsworth says: "Now quit your bologna-gargling and let's switch back to our original bodies."
Bender says: "Body switcher, eh?"
Bender says: "Mayhap the heist is back on."
Bender says: "Who needs accomplices, if I can just use their bodies."
Amy and the Professor sit in the machine. The Professor presses the button but the machine starts beeping. He presses multiple times.
Amy says: "Professor, what's not happening?"
Farnsworth says: "I failed to take into account the cerebral immune response."
Amy says: "You idiot!"
Farnsworth says: "However, perhaps they can."
Farnsworth says: "Maybe we can swap back using a third body for temporary storage space."
Bender says: "I'm 60% storage space."
Amy says: "See ya!"
Farnsworth says: "Now then, Amy, we'll simply switch bodies, and then we'll..."
Farnsworth says: "we'll..."
Farnsworth says: "No, I'd be back in my body, but then you and Bender would be switched."
Farnsworth says: "And the Amy and Bender bodies can't trade minds again, since they just did."
Amy says: "Oh no!"
Amy says: "Is it possible to get everyone back to normal using four or more bodies?"
Farnsworth ’’ says: "I'm not sure."
Farnsworth ’’ says: "I'm afraid we need to use..."
Farnsworth ’’ says: "MATH."

Amy says: "I'm Amy."
Amy says: "The Professor and I switched bodies."
Leela says: "Oh, lord."
Amy says: "All I wanted was to gorge myself a little, but I can't digest anything with these false teeth and this hit-or-miss colon."
Leela says: "At least, you get the senior discount at the movies."
Leela says: "I hate paying $14 to see Nicolas Cage solve things."
Amy says: "If you want to save $2, we could switch bodies."
Leela says: "We could always switch back, right?"
[Scene says: "Planet Express, Lounge."
[Scene says: "Amy, in Leela's body, is deep-frying something."
Fry says: "Hey, Leela."
Fry says: "Mmm."
Fry says: "What smells saturated?"

Fry says: "Woah."
Fry says: "That sounds like something Amy would say and eat."
Amy says: "I am Amy."
Amy says: "Leela and I used the Professor's mind-switching machine."
Amy says: "[She puts ketchup on her "creation"."
Fry says: "So Leela's in your body?"
Leela says: "Aha!"
Leela says: "You do only like me for my body."
Fry says: "That is entirely not true, sir!"

Bender says: "With all due respect, Your Majesty, I'm a robot like you."
Bender says: "I just switch bodies with some bimbo."
Bender says: "Go ahead, ask me something only a robot would know."
Nikolai says: "Ah, a reverse Turing test, eh?"
Nikolai says: "Very good."
Nikolai says: "What is the square root of nine?"
Bender says: "Okay, look, I'm not that kind of robot."
Bender says: "I'm more this kind."
Bender says: "[He starts beat boxing and Moonwalking."
Basil says: "He steps forwards but moves backwards."
Nikolai says: "By the gods!"
Nikolai says: "he is a machine!"
[Scene says: "Planet Express, the Professor's lab."

Fishy Joe says: "And fasten your seat belts."
Robot Clown says: "Oh, come on!"
Farnsworth says: "Good day."
Farnsworth says: "I am Nonchalanto, the robot daredevil."
Farnsworth says: "And my dream is to risk my life in strange and original ways."
Fishy Joe says: "Hmm."
Fishy Joe says: "You don't look so foolhardy to me."
The Professor takes the 5 of spades and puts it in his mouth. He unscrews his head and puts in on a lever. He jumps on to the opposing end, launching his head into the air. He takes an out automatic rifle and shoots at his head. His head lands in his neck and he shows Fishy the card. He shot through each of the spades.
Fishy Joe says: "That's the dumbest thing anybody's ever done."
Fishy Joe says: "Your hired!"

Nikolai says: "The jewels, the parties, the beautiful robo women."
Princess Flavia says: "Hello."
Bender's jaw drops.
Nikolai says: "My fiancée, Princess Flavia."
Nikolai says: "Dearest, meet Bender."
Nikolai says: "He's a robot in the body of a Chinese Martian physicist."
Flavia says: "How tedious."
Nikolai says: "Oh, to escape this gilded cage for a day."
Bender says: "Or more."
Bender says: "Much more."
Nikolai says: "In that horrible non-robot body."
Nikolai says: "Sir, I have my standards."
Bender says: "Ah, but what if I could put you in my fabulous bending-robot body?"
Nikolai says: "Me, posing as a lowly bending unit?"
Nikolai says: "How wicked!"
Nikolai says: "But wait, I'm supposed to give a speech at the UN tomorrow."
Nikolai says: "Can I trust you to do it?"
Bender says: "You can trust anything."

Fry; So now Leela's all crotchety because she thinks I'm not attracted to her in the Professor's body.
Hermes says: "You aren't, are you?"
Fry says: "Of course not!"
Fry says: "But I was willing to lie about it."
Fry says: "What more can a man do?"
Hermes says: "A man can give her a toke of her own medicine."
Fry says: "Yes!"
Fry says: "I can put my mind in a hideous body and show Leela she's not attracted to me."

Leela says: "Admit it!"
Leela says: "You don't care about the inner me at all!"
Fry says: "No, you admit it!"
Fry says: "You'd be ashamed to be seen in public with someone as hideous as me!"
