[Opening Credits. Caption says: "Beats A Hard Kick In The Face."
[Scene says: "Outside Planet Express."
[Scene says: "A calm, pleasant day..."
[Scene says: "until the top of the tower explodes in a huge fireball and electricity sparks around the rest of the building."
Farnsworth says: "Oh, Lordy Lou!"
Farnsworth says: "Help!"
[Cut to says: "Planet Express: Meeting Room."
[Cut to says: "Bender sleeps with his feet on the table and snores as the room shakes."
[Cut to says: "Parts of the ceiling fall."
[Cut to says: "Farnsworth screams."
[Cut to says: "Planet Express: Lounge."
[Cut to says: "Fry and Leela sit on the couch and the building continues shaking."
Fry says: "I know you've rejected me a lot before but, frankly, I wasn't sure we were right for each other either."
Fry says: "But now I am."
Fry says: "So how 'bout a date tonight?"
Leela says: "Sorry."
Leela says: "I think I, um, I think I left my toaster on."
Farnsworth says: "Buddha!"
Farnsworth says: "Zeus!"
Farnsworth says: "God!"
Farnsworth says: "One of you guys do something!"
Fry says: "Come on, Leela, what's the real reason you won't go out with me?"
Farnsworth says: "Help!"
Farnsworth says: "Satan!"
Farnsworth says: "You owe me!"
Leela says: "I have sweaty boot rash."
Amy looks up from the table.
Amy says: "No spluh!"
Amy says: "Why do you think I'm sitting over here in the stink-free zone?"
Fry laughs.
Fry says: "So, will you go out with me?"
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Meeting Room."
[Scene says: "The staff sit around the table."
[Scene says: "Farnsworth is covered in stains and tries to rub them off with a cloth."
Farnsworth says: "Good news, everyone."
Farnsworth says: "I'm still technically alive."
Farnsworth says: "Yes!"
Farnsworth says: "You'll have to throw it into the sun itself."
Farnsworth says: "For only the thermo-nuclear inferno of the sun has enough energy to ensure its total destruction."
Bender says: "I can hit it with a shovel."
Farnsworth says: "That's not good enough."
Bender says: "This one time I pounded a guy into the ground like a stake with a shovel."
Farnsworth says: "Yes, yes."
Zoidberg lifts the lid slightly.
Zoidberg says: "So what's in the box, already?"
Farnsworth says: "No peeking!"
Farnsworth says: "I don't know what's in there but I'm sure our minds would be unable to comprehend it."
Hermes lifts the lid and Farnsworth hits his hand with the hammer.
Hermes says: "Ow!"
Hermes says: "You hurt my collator!"
Farnsworth says: "I don't care."
Farnsworth says: "Pretty tantalising though!"
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab."
[Scene says: "The box is on a stool and Bender, Zoidberg, Fry, Leela and Hermes stand around it."
Fry says: "Whatever's in there, it's the only thing I've ever wanted."
Zoidberg says: "In my experience, boxes are usually empty."
Zoidberg says: "Or maybe with a little cheese stuck to the top."
Zoidberg says: "And one time pepperoni!"
Zoidberg says: "Give me the box!"
Hermes fires a laser into the air.
Hermes says: "Scram, you lousy green snakes!"
Hermes says: "Here, Leela."
Hermes says: "Take this and use it to shoot those guys."
He hands her the laser.
Leela says: "Right."
Leela says: "If they try to look in the box."
Hermes says: "Whatever."
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Meeting Room."
[Scene says: "Fry sits at the table while Bender paces around."
Fry says: "Let's just forget about the box."
Fry says: "The Professor said to stay away."
Bender says: "Fry, how can you be so naive?"
Bender says: "He was joking."
Bender says: "Get it?"
Fry says: "No."
Bender says: "That's what makes it so funny!"
Bender says: "OK, he wasn't joking."
Bender says: "Now shut up and follow me."
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Basement."
[Scene says: "Bender removes the hatch from a superheated steam pipe."
[Scene says: "A sign above the hatch reads "No Crawling Around"."
[Scene says: "He climbs in and Fry follows and screams."
Fry says: "Ow!"
Fry says: "It's hot!"
Fry says: "The butter in my pocket is melting."
[Cut to says: "Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab."
[Cut to says: "Above the room Bender removes the grate."
[Cut to says: "Vent."
[Cut to says: "Bender takes out his eyes and replaces them with bendy periscope-type eyes."
[Cut to says: "Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab."
[Cut to says: "Bender's eyes emerge from the vent and he scans the room."
[Cut to says: "Leela snores in the corner and Bender chuckles."
[Cut to says: "He extends his arms down to the box, picks it up and brings it back into the vent."
[Cut to says: "Fry groans."
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Basement."
Bender says: "We thank you, Bender, for the gift we are about to receive."
He lifts the lid and he and Fry gasp. Fry pulls something out.
Fry says: "Tangled-up Christmas lights!"
Fry says: "We can take shifts untangling them."
Bender says: "And unlabeled booze!"
Bender says: "Wide-mouth too!"
He drinks from it and Fry starts on the lights.
[Cut to says: "Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab."
Leela says: "That oughta keep those dopes occupied."
Leela says: "I can guard the real box in peace now that no one's curious about it."
She walks across the room and places the box back on the stool and picks up a magazine called Nosy Enquirer. She hums as she reads it. She looks up at the box but goes back to the magazine and hums louder.
Time Lapse. The next morning Leela is still in the lab guarding the box. A clock rings 7am.
Leela says: "Well, I got through the night and no one looked in the box."
Leela says: "Not even me."
Leela says: "The person who gave up her whole evening to watch it."
Leela says: "A whole evening of TV gone."
Leela says: "What a mockery of justice that I can't take even a little tiny peek."
Leela says: "Oh, it's deep."
Leela says: "Deeper than a small box should be."
She is sucked inside the box and screams.
[Cut to says: "Universe 1: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab."
[Cut to says: "Everything wobbles and the box changes colour from yellow to light blue."
[Cut to says: "Leela is ejected from it and lands on the floor."
Leela A says: "Ouch!"
Leela A says: "My lawyer will hear about this!"
Enter Fry. His hair is black and his jacket is green.
Fry 1 says: "Leela, what have you done?"
Leela A says: "Nothing."
Leela A says: "What do you mean "Why was I looking in the box?"
Fry 1 says: "I mean your hair."
Fry 1 says: "It's all different-y."
Enter a golden Bender.
Leela A says: "Bender?"
Leela A says: "Is that you?"
Bender 1 says: "You know it!"
Bender 1 says: "Large and in charge!"
Farnsworth walks in. He has a scar all the way around his head.
Farnsworth 1 says: "Leela?"
Farnsworth 1 says: "Oh, there's a woman for you!"
Farnsworth 1 says: "Always dyeing her hair instead of not looking in a box."
Leela A says: "I didn't dye my hair."
Leela A says: "This is how I always look."
Bender 1 says: "No, that's how you always look."
Bender 1 says: "This throws my entire perception of reality into question."
Bender 1 says: "Clone?"
Bender 1 says: "Robot?"
Bender 1 says: "Or long-lost twin?"
Bender 1 says: "Taking all bets!"
Bender 1 says: "I also offer video poker."
Time Lapse.
Fry 1 says: "It's some guy wearing a Leela costume!"
Fry 1 says: "Get him!"
Leela A whips out Hermes' laser and points it at them.
Leela A says: "Hold it!"
Leela A says: "You have this all wrong."
Leela A says: "I just fell into the box and then I fell out somehow."
Fry 1 says: "You shut up, sir!"
Farnsworth 1 says: "No, wait!"
Farnsworth 1 says: "I've got it."
Farnsworth 1 says: "I know what's in the box."
Farnsworth 1 says: "Oh, I've been as dumb as Fry."
Fry 1 says: "Am not!"
Farnsworth 1 says: "It contains a parallel universe."
Farnsworth 1 says: "And when you create a parallel universe, it's almost always populated by evil twins."
Leela A says: "Now, look: I am not evil."
Leela A says: "My loan officer said so."
Farnsworth 1 says: "Oh, you'd like us to believe that wouldn't you, Leela?"
Farnsworth 1 says: "Or should I say Evil-a?"
Bender 1 says: "Oh, this is awful."
Bender 1 says: "Somewhere there's a Bender more evil than me."
Bender 1 says: "I do my best, damnit!"
Farnsworth 1 says: "Leela?"
Farnsworth 1 says: "Here."
Leela A says: "I tell you they're not evil."
Leela A says: "But don't be confused."
Leela A says: "They are jerks."
Leela 1 dives into the box.
Zoidberg A says: "Hello!"
Leela 1 says: "Hi-yah!"
She punches him.
Zoidberg A says: "Ow!"
Leela 1 jumps back through the box. She points the laser back into it.
Leela 1 says: "Come out of your universe with your hands up!"
Enter Fry, Bender, Amy, Zoidberg and Farnsworth. They put up their hands.
Fry A says: "Oh, wow!"
Fry A says: "It's like that drug trip I saw in that movie when I was on that drug trip."
Farnsworth A says: "Astonishing!"
Farnsworth A says: "I must have created a parallel universe."
Farnsworth 1 says: "Baldercrap!"
Farnsworth 1 says: "I created your universe."
Farnsworth 1 says: "All you created was my fist parallel to your face."
He weakly punches him.
Farnsworth A says: "Ow."
Leela A says: "Look, it doesn't matter who created what."
Leela A says: "The important thing is-- Yah!"
She kicks the laser out of Leela 1's hand. Leela 1 leans back to Farnsworth 1.
Leela 1 says: "We're exactly the same."
Leela 1 says: "I know all her moves."
Leela 1 says: "Therefore, I've got the upper hand."
Both Leelas fly at each other, collide and fall to the floor.
Farnsworth 1 says: "Now, now."
Farnsworth 1 says: "Perfectly symmetrical violence never solved anything."
[Scene says: "Universe 1: Planet Express: Meeting Room."
[Scene says: "Both staffs sit around the table."
Farnsworth A says: "Let's recap what's happened so far."
Farnsworth A says: "As you can see, I accidentally created a box containing your universe."
Farnsworth 1 says: "While I, in a simultaneous blunder, created a box containing your universe."
Leela A says: "This is getting confusing."
Leela A says: "Why don't we call our universe "Universe A" and this universe "Universe B"?"
Bender 1 says: "Hey!"
Bender 1 says: "Why can't we be Universe A?"
Fry 1 says: "Yeah!"
Amy 1 says: "Yeah!"
Farnsworth 1 says: "We want A!"
Zoidberg 1 says: "It's the best letter!"
Fry A says: "We called it first."
Fry A says: "Besides, this place kinda feels like a "B", y'know?"
Leela 1 says: "Alright, you can be crummy Universe A and we'll be Universe 1."
Fry 1 says: "Or "The Mongooses"."
Fry 1 says: "That's a cool team name."
Fry 1 says: "The Fighting Mongooses!"
Farnsworth A says: "Wait a second."
Farnsworth A says: "If everyone is identical, why did our Leela look into the box and your Leela didn't?"
Leela 1 says: "Well, to be honest, I tossed a coin."
Leela 1 says: "It came up tails so I didn't look."
Leela A says: "That's weird."
Leela A says: "Mine came up heads, so I did."
Farnsworth A says: "Interesting."
Farnsworth A says: "Apparently, the key difference between our universes is that coin flips have opposite outcomes."
Bender A says: "That explains fruity here!"
Bender A says: "I tossed a coin to pick my finish."
Bender A says: "Fog hat grey!"
Bender 1 says: "Hey!"
Bender 1 says: "Bite my glorious golden ass!"
Farnsworth A says: "You people and your slight differences disgust me."
Farnsworth A says: "I'm going home."
Farnsworth A says: "Where's that blue box with our universe in it?"
Farnsworth 1 says: "Oh, you'd like to get back to your evil universe, wouldn't you?"
Farnsworth 1 says: "And destroy your box with our universe inside it."
Farnsworth A says: "Nonsense!"
Farnsworth A says: "I would never do such a thing unless you were already having been going to do that!"
Farnsworth 1 says: "Wha?"
Farnsworth A says: "You heard me!"
Farnsworth 1 says: "In any case, I've hidden the box and it will remain hidden until I'm convinced you're not evil."
Farnsworth 1 says: "Everyone, keep an eye on your evil counterpart."
Farnsworth A turns to his staff.
Farnsworth A says: "And you all do the same!"
Leela 1 says: "Um, can Fry and I watch our parallel selves together?"
Leela 1 says: "We have plans tonight."
Leela A says: "You guys are dating?!"
Leela A says: "!"
Fry 1 says: "Oh, no, no."
Fry 1 says: "We're married."
Leela 1 puts her arms around him and they kiss. Fry's and Leela's jaws drop.
[Scene says: "Universe 1: New New York City Street."
[Scene says: "Bender A and Bender 1 watch each other as they walk."
Bender A says: "I've got my eye on you, boy!"
Bender 1 says: "Don't even think about it, lunch-pail!"
Bender 1 says: "You'd be dead before you hit the ground."
Bender A says: "Good point."
Bender A says: "Whattya say we just hit a strip joint?"
Bender 1 says: "I was waitin' for one of us to say that!"
Bender 1 says: "Bender A, you're a prince among robots."
Bender 1 says: "Can you forgive me for distrusting you?"
They hug.
Bender A says: "Aw!"
Bender A says: "I can't stay mad at what is essentially me."
Bender A says: "I love me!"
They take each other's wallets and chuckle.
[Scene says: "Universe 1: Planet Express: Lounge."
[Scene says: "Amy 1 and Amy A paint their toenails."
Amy 1 says: "This is so great!"
Amy 1 says: "I always wanted an imaginary friend!"
Amy A says: "I'm not imaginary, I'm parallel."
Amy A says: "We're exactly the same, right down to the--  Splech!"
Amy A says: "Is that pink nail polish?"
Amy 1 points at Amy A's yellow toenails.
Amy 1 says: "Is that not pink nail polish?"
Amy 1 says: "The Professor's right, you are evil."
Amy 1 says: "And shallow."
Amy A says: "I am not evil!"
[Scene says: "Universe 1: Elzar's Fine Cuisine."
[Scene says: "The Frys and Leelas sit at a table."
[Scene says: "Fry A and Leela A are dressed as usual while Fry 1 and Leela 1 are more formally dressed."
Leela A says: "So, Fry, Leela, how'd you two get together?"
Fry 1 says: "Funny story."
Fry 1 says: "I asked Leela out a million times but she just kept rejecting me."
Leela 1 says: "I'd make up stuff like "I have sweaty boot rash" or "I have to meet the President"!"
She laughs. Fry A glares at Leela A.
Fry 1 says: "Oh, man, you never heard such excuses!"
Fry 1 says: "But, like a dope, I believed her."
Fry 1 says: "Looking back on it now, it's kinda funny."
Fry A says: "It sure is."
Fry A says: "Right, Leela?"
Fry A says: "Funny."
Fry A says: "Ha ha ha ha!"
Leela 1 says: "Then one night, when Fry asked me out, the only excuse I could think of involved ghosts."
Leela 1 says: "I knew he wouldn't buy it, so I did what I always do in those situations."
Leela A says: "Oh, Lord..."
Leela 1 says: "I flipped a coin."
Leela 1 says: "It came up heads and we went out."
Fry A turns to Leela A, who appears embarassed.
Fry A says: "You mean you flipped a coin too?"
Fry A says: "And it was tails?"
Fry A says: "So that's why you said you had to meet that ghost."
Leela 1 says: "You really missed out on something, Leela."
Leela 1 says: "That date was magical."
Fry 1 says: "One year later, I gave Leela a diamond scrunchie and we were married."
Leela 1 turns around and shows Leela the scrunchie.
Leela A says: "Ooh!"
Fry A says: "One year later, I got beat up at a Neil Diamond concert by a guy named Scrunchie!"
[Scene says: "Universe 1: Planet Express: Meeting Room."
[Scene says: "The two Farnsworth's change the chandelier-mo-stat and the lights brighten and dim."
Farnsworth 1 says: "Well, that was pointless."
Farnsworth A says: "Say, I hope you won't think it "evil" of me to ask how you got that stylish head wound."
Farnsworth 1 says: "Oh, this old thing?"
Farnsworth 1 says: "I was experimenting to see if I could remove my own brain."
Farnsworth A says: "Of course!"
Farnsworth A says: "I had the same idea."
Farnsworth A says: "I flipped a coin to decide if I should proceed."
Farnsworth A says: "But it came up tails, so I didn't."
Farnsworth A says: "How'd it go?"
Farnsworth 1 says: "Well getting the brain out was the easy part."
Farnsworth 1 says: "The hard part was getting the brain out!"
He laughs madly. Farnsworth A chuckles.
Farnsworth A says: "Oh, you!"
[Scene says: "Universe 1: Alley."
[Scene says: "The two Zoidbergs sit in a dumpster."
[Scene says: "Flies buzz around them."
Zoidberg 1 says: "So, tell me about yourself."
Zoidberg A says: "Well, don't look into it, but I'm a respected internal medicine doctor."
Zoidberg A says: "Ooh!"
Zoidberg A says: "A can!"
He picks up the can and slurps the contents of it.
Zoidberg 1 says: "As for me, I design mansions, then live in them."
Zoidberg 1 says: "I'm lying!"
Zoidberg 1 says: "I'm an appalling failure!"
Zoidberg cries too.
Zoidberg A says: "Me too!"
Zoidberg A says: "A big, fat one!"
Zoidberg 1 says: "And those co-workers, always looking down on us Zoidbergs."
Zoidberg 1 says: "What are they, from Nob Hill?"
Zoidberg A says: "They're all like "Stop spraying me with ink, Zoidberg!"
Zoidberg A says: "" "Put on pants, Zoidberg!"
Zoidberg A says: "" "Don't touch our fancy box, Zoidberg!"
Zoidberg 1 says: "Oh, that box!"
Zoidberg 1 says: "Too good for us, is it?"
Zoidberg A says: "Bah!"
Zoidberg A says: "Someday they'll watch from down in the gutter, they will, as King Zoidberg caresses their fancy box."
Zoidberg 1 says: "You know, maybe a certain blue lobster saw where Professor hid the box."
Zoidberg A laughs evilly and Zoidberg 1 joins in.
[Scene says: "Universe 1: Planet Express: Meeting Room."
Farnsworth 1 says: "Good news, everyones!"
Farnsworth A says: "After carefully reading the scriptures, we've concluded that none of us are evil."
Farnsworth 1 says: "Yes, the Bible is the real good news."
Farnsworth 1 says: "Anyhow, you're all free to go back to your own universe."
Enter Hermes 1.
Hermes 1 says: "What's goin' on here?"
Hermes 1 says: "Why aren't you all out destroying the Professor's box?"
Leela 1 says: "Hermes, aren't you curious about the fact that there's two of everybody?"
Hermes 1 says: "No."
Hermes 1 says: "Now like my granny used to say back in her tarpaper shack on Montego Bay, "If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself."
Farnsworth 1 says: "Your granny can go to hell!"
Farnsworth 1 says: "I've hidden the box so no one can destroy the home universe of my handsome friend here."
Farnsworth A says: "Oh, go on!"
Farnsworth A says: "Wait a second."
Farnsworth A says: "If your Hermes was about to destroy the box containing our universe..."
Farnsworth 1 says: "Then your Hermes..."
Farnsworth A says: "Oh, my!"
[Scene says: "Outside Planet Express."
[Scene says: "In Universe A, the hangar doors slide open."
[Cut to says: "Planet Express: Hangar."
[Cut to says: "Hermes walks up the steps into the ship."
Narrator says: "And sure enough..."
Hermes says: "Like Granny said, "If you want a box hurled into the sun, you got to do it yourself."
Hermes says: "" God rest her zombie bones."
[Scene says: "Universe 1: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab."
Leela A says: "So we go back through the box and stop Hermes?"
Farnsworth A says: "Right."
Farnsworth A says: "Good thing Professor B there hid it in the coelacanth tank."
Farnsworth A says: "No one but a crazy lobster would look there!"
In the tank Farnsworth 1 opens a giant shell. There is nothing inside.
Farnsworth 1 says: "It's gone!"
[Cut to says: "Universe 1: Alley."
[Cut to says: "Zoidberg 1 sits on a bin holding the box and wearing a Slurm cup on his head."
[Cut to says: "Zoidberg A bows to him."
Zoidberg A says: "All hail Zoidberg, the king with the box!"
Zoidberg A says: "Now it's my turn, maybe?"
Zoidberg 1 says: "The box says no."
[Scene says: "Ships Cockpit."
Narrator says: "Meanwhile in Universe A, Hermes A heads towards the sun..."
Narrator says: "A."
Hermes holds a "Box Destruction Checklist".
Hermes says: "Item one: Box."
Hermes says: "Check!"
Hermes says: "Item two: Sun."
Hermes says: "That's a big check."
He pulls a visor down and it bursts into flames. He gasps.
[Scene says: "Universe 1: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab."
Hermes 1 says: "If I know parallel Hermes, he's at the sun by now."
Bender 1 says: "Our universe is doomed!"
Bender 1 says: "Doooooooomed!"
Bender A says: "Doooooooomed!"
Farnsworth 1 says: "Now don't give up yet, you cry babies."
Farnsworth 1 says: "The box is gone but we still have one preposterously slim hope."
Amy A says: "Is it a kind of hairspray?"
Farnsworth A says: "No!"
Farnsworth A says: "We must attempt to make another box containing our universe."
Farnsworth A says: "Doy!"
He slaps his head.
Time Lapse. Farnsworth A pulls the switch on a machine and the lights dim. Several boxes come out of it on a conveyor belt. The two Farnsworths scream madly while everyone else remains calm.
Time Lapse. Several boxes are on the floor. Fry A picks one up and puts it over his head.
Fry 1 says: "Well?"
Fry 1 says: "Is that your universe in there?"
Fry A says: "Nope."
Fry A says: "Too cold."
He takes the box off his head. It is frozen in a block of ice. Farnsworth puts his head inside another box and kissing sounds come from inside it.
Farnsworth A says: "I'll put this one aside for later."
Leela A runs by with her head in a box and tentacles emerging from it.
Hermes 1 says: "Oh, man, it's hopeless!"
Hermes 1 says: "We'll never find your universe in time."
Hermes 1 says: "Plus, this box is stuck on my fat head."
Farnsworth 1 says: "Yes, it's the apocalypse alright."
Farnsworth 1 says: "I always thought I'd have a hand in it."
Bender 1 says: "I'm not sad because I finally found someone as great as me."
Bender 1 says: "It's like I always say, "Make new friends and keep the old."
Bender A says: ""And the other's gold."
They hug and cry. The Zoidbergs walk in with the right box.
Zoidberg 1 says: "Why with the long faces?"
Leela 1 gasps.
Leela 1 says: "The idiots have the box!"
Zoidberg A says: "I think she means you."
Farnsworth 1 says: "Grab them!"
They surround the two Zoidbergs and back them against the shelves containing the other universes. The shelves wobble and Universe #25 falls off and lands on Zoidberg A, taking him and Universe A with it.
Zoidberg 1 says: "You coward!"
Zoidberg 1 says: "Wait for me!"
He picks up the box and drops it over his head. He runs around with his legs sticking out and woops. He runs into the shelves and all the other boxes fall off.
Amy says: "Blug!"
Amy says: "Which one did they go into?"
Farnsworth A says: "Oh, let's all ask each other!"
Farnsworth A says: "That'll solve this problem!"
Farnsworth 1 says: "We'll each have to search a universe."
Farnsworth 1 says: "Everyone, grab a length of wire first so you can find your way back."
They each grab a wire anchored to his lab table and jump into a parabox.
[Scene says: "Universe 25."
[Scene says: "The Zoidbergs come in via a box and leave via another box."
[Scene says: "Amy 1 follows and looks around."
Amy 1 says: "Hello?"
Amy 1 says: "Did you see two smelly lobsters?"
Hermes 25 says: "We didn't see anything..."
Hermes 25 says: "..."
Hermes 25 says: "ever!"
[Scene says: "Universe 1729."
[Scene says: "Enter Fry."
Fry says: "Yo!"
Fry says: "Uh, did two shellfish in scrubs go by?"
The people in this universe have giant carnival heads.
Fry 1729 says: "Hell, no!"
Leela 1729 says: "Shut up!"
Bender 1729 says: "Beat it, jerk!"
[Scene says: "Universe 31."
[Scene says: "Leela A pokes her head into the universe."
[Scene says: "Blocky robots shaped like the staff approach her."
Leela A says: "Uh, have you robot versions of you guys seen any extra Zoidbergs around here?"
Fry 31 says: "Negative."
Fry 31 says: "Will you go out with me?"
Leela A says: "Uh, access denied."
Fry 31's head explodes.
[Scene says: "Universe XVII."
[Scene says: "The Professor's lab resembles an ancient study and Farnsworth XVII writes on a blackboard."
[Scene says: "Enter the Benders behind him."
Bender 1 says: "Hey, pal, look what I snagged from the Leprechaun Universe!"
He opens his chest cabinet and pulls out a crock o' gold.
Bender says: "Yeah, Leprechaun Universe is fine..."
Bender says: "if you haven't seen Pirate Universe!"
He pulls out a treasure chest. Bender 1 gasps.
Bender 1 says: "Faith and begorra!"
They leave. Farnsworth XVII turns around.
Farnsworth XVII says: "Quae?"
[Scene says: "Universe 420."
[Scene says: "Enter the Zoidbergs."
Zoidberg A says: "Quick!"
Zoidberg A says: "Into another box!"
Zoidberg 1 says: "There aren't any in this universe, there aren't."
Zoidberg 1 says: "Hey, you, what with the no boxes?"
Farnsworth is a hippy and Amy rubs his shoulders.
Farnsworth 420 says: "Baby, they're somewhere."
Farnsworth 420 says: "Everything's like somewhere!"
Farnsworth 420 says: "Place is kinda au naturel right now."
Enter Farnsworth A and Farnsworth 1.
Farnsworth 1 says: "There they are!"
The Zoidbergs scream. Farnsworth A takes the parabox away from them.
Farnsworth A says: "Gotcha!"
Farnsworth 420 says: "Dig it!"
Farnsworth 420 says: "All of you fitting in this boxed is like seriously freaked up!"
Farnsworth 1 says: "Nonsense!"
Farnsworth 1 says: "Why, there's a whole universe in there."
Farnsworth 420 says: "Dude, there's a universe in all of us."
Amy 420 puts her arms around him.
Amy 420 says: "Right on, Professor Freaksworth!"
Farnsworth 420 offers Farnsworth A a flower.
Farnsworth A says: "Get a job!"
Farnsworth A says: "We've got the box."
Farnsworth A says: "Everyone, pull your wires."
They pull them and are reeled in.
[Scene says: "Universe 1: Planet Express: Farnsworth's Lab."
[Scene says: "Everyone flies in and lands in a pile by the lab table."
Farnsworth A says: "Hurry!"
Farnsworth A says: "Back to Universe A!"
The A's and 1's jump into the box.
[Scene says: "Ships Ejection Port."
[Scene says: "The ship has arrived at the sun and Hermes prepares to eject the box."
[Scene says: "He pushes it through the slot into the airlock and is about to press the eject button when the box shakes and the A's and 1's jump out of it."
[Scene says: "They are trapped in the airlock."
[Scene says: "Farnsworth bangs his fists on the glass."
Farnsworth A says: "Hermes, don't press that button!"
Hermes thinks about it.
Hermes says: "OK."
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Meeting Room."
[Scene says: "The staff part with their parallel selves."
Fry A says: "Bye."
Leela A says: "Good luck, Leela."
Zoidberg A says: "So long, Your Majesty!"
Amy 1 says: "Later!"
Zoidberg 1 climbs into the box. Fry 1 and Leela 1 kiss and climb in.
Fry says: "There but for the flip of a coin go we."
Fry says: "So, um, Leela?"
Fry says: "Seeing how the universe wasn't destroyed, you wanna catch an ape fight?"
Fry says: "You know, together?"
Leela says: "Well, I guess you deserve one more flip."
She flips the coin.
Fry says: "So, heads or tails?"
Leela looks at the coin.
Leela says: "Y'know, let's just say it's heads."
Fry smiles. Farnsworth reaches into the parabox and Farnsworth 1's hand comes out.
Farnsworth says: "Ready?"
Farnsworth says: "and  One, two, three, pull!"
The paraboxes fold into each other. Farnsworth now holds the blue box.
Farnsworth says: "There."
Farnsworth says: "That space-time eversion has given us their box and vice versa."
Farnsworth says: "Correct!"
Farnsworth says: "This box contains our own universe."
Everyone gasps.
Hermes says: "Sweet honey bee of infinity!"
Bender takes the box from Farnsworth and shakes it. The building shakes.
Leela says: "Bender!"
Leela says: "Quit destroying the universe!"
She snatches the box away and the room shakes again.
He groans.
Farnsworth says: "Yes, all that is and ever shall be is in that box."
Farnsworth says: "And the box itself is probably worth something too."
Farnsworth says: "We must cherish it, as we cherish every moment of our lives."
[Scene says: "Planet Express: Lounge."
[Scene says: "Zoidberg, Bender and Leela sit on the couch."
[Scene says: "Bender changes the channel."
[Scene says: "Fry walks in and sees there is no space left on the couch so he sits on the parabox, making the universe compressed."
[Scene says: "He sighs in comfort."
