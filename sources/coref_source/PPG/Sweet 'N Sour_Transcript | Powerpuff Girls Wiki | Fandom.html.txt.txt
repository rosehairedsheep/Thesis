Opening shot; the city skyline in the day time.
Narrator says: "The city of Townsville!"
The camera pulls down to where we see Townsville National Bank as it explodes Where a typical day is exploding with typical crimes. Mojo Jojo giggles as we cut to Fuzzy Lumpkins playing a sour note on his banjo "Jo" Where sour notes are usually exspective. We cut to the old lady who was scared of the shadows of the Gangreen Gang And the usualler suspects. Are always en-large. Big Billy push Ace, Lil' Arturo, Grubber and Snake out of the way. Then three girls from the shadows flew up as we see Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup flying up in the sky But to to preform... The Powerpuff Girls always come to the rescue! Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup started to kicked butt at Grubber, Snake, Lil' Arturo, Big Billy and Ace. The old lady put her thumb up at the girls. Buttercup and Bubbles hit Fuzzy Lumpkins in the head with his Banjo "Jo" and Blossom breaks it in half and all the people cheered and Fuzzy hangs his head down sadly. Then Blossom, Bubbles and Buttercup kicked butt at Mojo Jojo as Mojo Jojo flew toward the newspaper pile as it got ruin and one got zoomed in on screen saying "PPGS save the day" Then we cut to the girls in their bedroom. Buttercup is playing with a toy car, Blossom is reading the newspaper and Bubbles is kissing her stuffed animals.
Blossom says: "It's the same old same old, I tell you."
Bubbles says: "Ooh, little puppy, I love you..."
Buttercup says: "Geez, Bubbles, they're just stuffed animals."
