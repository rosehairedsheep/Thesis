Blossom says: "What is it, Professor?"
Professor Utonium says: "Well, the house has been cluttered lately, so, I thought we could do a little spring cleaning."
Bubbles says: "Spring cleaning?"
Bubbles says: "But, Professor, it's fall."
Professor Utonium says: "I know, Bubbles."
Professor Utonium says: "I'm flipping the script!"
Buttercup says: "Hi-larious."
Professor Utonium says: "I've already put all the things we need to organize in this pile."
Professor Utonium says: "You just need to decide what to do with it."
Bubbles says: "Ooh!"
Bubbles says: "I know!"
Bubbles says: "We can put the stuff we wanna keep in this box."
Buttercup says: "And the stuff we wanna toss in this one!"
Blossom says: "Two options?"
Blossom says: "That's so bilateral!"
Blossom says: "Allow me to take charge."
Professor Utonium says: "No, Blossom."
Professor Utonium says: "I want the three of you to work together on this one."
Blossom says: "All right, girls."
Blossom says: "Let's get..."
Bubbles says: "As long as I wear this shirt and the scrunchie."
Buttercup says: "Let's get this party started!"
Buttercup says: "Keep!"
Bubbles says: "Toss!"
Buttercup says: "Keep!"
Bubbles says: "Toss!"
Blossom says: "No!"
Blossom says: "No keep!"
Blossom says: "No toss!"
Blossom says: "Can't you see?"
Blossom says: "2 piles aren't enough."
Bubbles says: "They're not?"
Buttercup says: "They're not?"
Blossom says: "Not unless you want to give something away by accident."
Blossom says: "We need a system that categorizes items from most to least important."
Buttercup says: "Whoa, dude."
Buttercup says: "Professor told us to work together!"
Blossom says: "And we are working together, by my plan!"
Blossom says: "Trust me."
Blossom says: "It'll be done in a jiffy."
Blossom says: "Irregular coasters, check."
Blossom says: "Bubbles, your break isn't for another fifteen minutes!"
Buttercup says: "Blossom, this stinks."
Buttercup says: "Your crazy system makes no sense!"
Blossom says: "Yes, it does."
Blossom says: "You're just not doing it right."
Buttercup says: "Admit it, dude."
Buttercup says: "Bubbles and my idea was way better."
Blossom says: "No, you just don't get it."
Blossom says: "I'll do it myself and you'll see."
Buttercup says: "Cool."
Blossom says: "Uh, cool?"
Buttercup says: "Cool!"
Buttercup says: "Less work for us."
Bubbles says: "But, where does the red car go?"
Blossom says: "Hmph!"
Blossom says: "I guess if you want something done right, you just have to do it yourself."
Blossom says: "Let's see what I have left..."
Blossom says: "Aha!"
Fish Spirit says: "Food!"
Blossom says: "What are you doing?"
Spirit Girl says: "Ooh!"
Blossom says: "What?"
Green Spirit says: "Yo, this mirror doesn't work at all."
Green Spirit says: "So I smashed it."
Blossom says: "That's not a mirror!"
Blossom says: "That's a TV!"
Blossom says: "Hey, what's going on here?"
Spirit Head 2 says: "We've been stuck in that box for 3,000 years."
Spirit Head 1 says: "And some mortal just let us out!"
Blossom says: "Wait!"
Blossom says: "I let you out, but..."
Spirit Heads says: "You?"
Spirit Head 1 says: "Guys!"
Spirit Head 1 says: "Guys, this is the girl who set us free."
Spirit Head 2 says: "So, we can take over the world tomorrow!"
Blossom says: "Take over the world?"
Spirit Head 1 says: "She is the evilest girl of all!"
Blossom says: "Me?"
Spirit Head 1 says: "But before we take over the world, we are gonna party!"
Spirits says: "Party!"
Spirits says: "Party!"
Alien says: "Help."
Alien says: "I've crashed on this disco dance planet."
Chorus says: "Space Towtruck!"
Bubbles says: "Do you think we should check up on Blossom?"
Buttercup says: "Pssh!"
Buttercup says: "No."
Buttercup says: "We'd be getting in the way of her "plan"."
Blossom says: "MY PLAN ISN'T WORKING!"
Blossom says: "Alright, Blossom."
Blossom says: "Don't panic."
Blossom says: "You deal with monsters everyday."
Blossom says: "OK, MONSTERS!"
Afro Spirit says: "Whoo!"
Afro Spirit says: "Ice slide!"
Blossom says: "Plan C, Eye beams!"
Alien says: "Ahh!"
Alien says: "What am I gonna do now?"
Buttercup says: "What is even going on?"
Bubbles says: "Aww!"
Bubbles says: "Kitties!"
Fairy says: "Did someone call my name?"
Blossom says: "Are you another monster?"
Hope says: "No."
Blossom says: "Do you know how to get rid of these monsters?"
Hope says: "Uh..."
Hope says: "whoa, this is fun!"
Blossom says: "Well?"
Hope says: "Oh, yes!"
Hope says: "I know how to get rid of these spirits before they wreak havoc on the works for all eternity."
Blossom says: "Eternity?"
Blossom says: "Ugh!"
Blossom says: "So, anyway..."
Blossom says: "Hey!"
Blossom says: "You're supposed to help me!"
Hope says: "Trampoline!"
Hope says: "I'm jumping to the sky and stuff!"
Blossom says: ""Got caught up, but on my way home now."
Blossom says: "" On his way home?!"
Blossom says: "!"
Blossom says: "What am I gonna do?!"
Blossom says: "!"
Spirit says: "You're gonna party!"
Spirits says: "Evil!"
Spirits says: "Evil!"
Spirits says: "Evil!"
Bubbles says: "Wow."
Bubbles says: "Everyone really loved to dance in the 70's."
Blossom says: "Help."
Buttercup says: "Well, look who came crawling back!"
Spirit says: "Whoo-hoo-hoo!"
Spirit says: "Nice party, evil girl!"
Bubbles says: ""Evil girl"?"
Buttercup says: "So, what part of your 19-point plan does this fall under?"
Blossom says: "I know, I know."
Blossom says: "I'm sorry."
Blossom says: "I was wrong."
Buttercup says: "Hold up."
Buttercup says: "Say that again."
Blossom says: "I was wrong."
Blossom says: "I've should've..."
Buttercup says: "Okay."
Buttercup says: "Now, into the phone."
Blossom says: "I was wrong."
Ringtone says: "I was wrong."
Buttercup says: "New ringtone!"
Blossom says: "Alright, alright, alright."
Blossom says: "Guys, we have to get those monsters back in that box!"
Blossom says: "And that girl is the only one who knows how."
Buttercup says: "Blossom, we can help you out, but you need to trust us!"
Blossom says: "Okay, okay, okay."
Blossom says: "Whatever."
Bubbles says: "On it!"
Blossom says: "There is no way she'll get her to talk."
Bubbles says: "I'm back!"
Bubbles says: "1, Hope likes animals much as I do."
Bubbles says: "2, she won't get off the trampoline."
Bubbles says: "3, she said all we have to do is send the monsters back, is get them to say "Ta leme"."
Bubbles says: "It means "See you later" in Greek."
Buttercup says: "See?"
Buttercup says: "Bubs rocks."
Blossom says: "Okay, let's do plan."
Buttercup says: "You said you'd listen to us."
Blossom says: "Yeah."
Blossom says: "But, plan..."
Buttercup says: "Listen to us."
Blossom says: "Fine."
Buttercup says: "Alright, Bubs."
Buttercup says: "You know what to do."
