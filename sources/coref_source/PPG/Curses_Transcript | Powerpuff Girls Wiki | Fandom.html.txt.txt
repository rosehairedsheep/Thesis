Narrator says: "The city of Townsville!"
Narrator says: "Where there’s always something cooking."
Quick pan to the kitchen of the girls’ house. Dirty pots and pans are stacked everywhere, and we can hear other dishes being shuffled o.c. A small TV sits in the foreground, next to the sink with its screen turned away from the camera, and a female voice is heard—the host of a cooking show, sounding a bit like Julia Child.
Host says: "All right, it’s almost time to put that turkey in the oven."
The Professor hustles across the screen—he is the source of the clatter and mess, and he has put on an apron and rolled up his sleeves. A large turkey rests on a platter in his hands. The next several lines overlap.
Professor says: "Turkey in the oven."
Host says: "Next we’ll tackle the vegetable stuffing."
Host says: "Now take your veggies and—"
Host says: "—"
Host says: "julienne them like so."
Host says: "Not very difficult."
Host says: "Now mix them in with the tomato coulis we prepared earlier."
On the end of this, he crosses the kitchen again, this time with an armload of vegetables in tow. The distinct sound of creaking metal from the oven’s general direction combines with his next words to obscure the start of the host’s next sentence.
Host says: "—"
Host says: "and stuff it into the turkey."
Professor says: "The turkey?"
Professor says: "But it’s in the oven already."
Host says: "See how easy it goes in?"
Host says: "Everything should be running just smooth as silk."
Of course, it is not. There is an o.c. explosion—the oven just gave up the ghost—that obscures her next few words.
Professor says: "Oh, dear!"
Host says: "Make sure you don’t set that temperature too high, or you’ll be putting out a three-alarm fire."
Host says: "All right, now sit yourself down and enjoy a nice cold beverage—"
During the previous line, the Professor runs o.c. away from the oven, then back toward it with a fire extinguisher. White clouds of carbon dioxide vapor drift back into view as he uses the thing. Cut to outside the kitchen door; smoke billows into the hallway as his panicked shriek rings out. Pan/tilt up to the door of the girls’ bedroom, then cut to inside. Buttercup floats up into view, with a building block in hand aimed for the top of a tower.
Buttercup says: "Hey, somebody go down and see if dinner’s ready."
Buttercup says: "I’m hungry."
Blossom says: "I’m busy."
Blossom says: "You go."
Buttercup says: "No, you go!"
Blossom says: "No, you!"
Buttercup says: "You!"
Blossom says: "You!"
Buttercup says: "You!"
Blossom says: "You!"
Buttercup says: "Fine."
Buttercup says: "Bubbles, you go."
The third sister is lying on the floor and working intently on a coloring book.
Bubbles says: "I can’t."
Bubbles says: "I’m in the zone!"
Buttercup says: "Okay, then."
Buttercup says: "Let’s rock-scissor-paper for it."
Close-up of a point between the girls. Each reaches one hand into view and shakes it during the count of the next line, as you might do when playing this game.
Girls says: "Ready?"
Girls says: "One, two, three!"
Blossom says: "Scissors beats paper!"
Buttercup says: "Now go see what’s for dinner."
Bubbles says: "I always lose at this game!"
Back to the kitchen. A pot of something is boiling on the stove. During the next line, the Professor runs across with another armload of vegetables.
Host says: "All right, let’s turn up the heat, shall we?"
Host says: "It’s time to check that sauce."
Professor says: "Sauce."
Professor says: "Right."
He shoots out one hand and grabs the pot’s handle. The sizzle of flesh on metal does not immediately register in his brain—but after a second his eyes bug out and he sinks his teeth into his lower lip to stifle a scream. Everything he ever learned about heat transfer has just come back to him in one agonizing instant. Finally he pulls free and regards his steaming appendage.
Professor says: "Mother of all **TEA-KETTLE WHISTLING**!"
Cut to the boiling kettle on the stove. Pull back to frame the unfortunate man, sucking frantically at his scalded fingers—and Bubbles, floating unnoticed behind him with Octi in her grasp. Her face betrays her complete shock at what she has just overheard.
Back to the bedroom. As Blossom continues reading and Buttercup waits impatiently with another block in hand, Bubbles floats along the balcony to the doorway. Her expression has not changed.
Buttercup says: "Hey, Bubbles."
Buttercup says: "What’s for dinner?"
Blossom says: "Hey, Bubbles…Bubbles?"
She floats across the room, paying no heed, and stops near Buttercup and the tower of blocks.
Buttercup says: "Hel-lo?"
Buttercup says: "Earth to Bubbles!"
Buttercup says: "Dinner?"
Cut to the coloring book on the floor. Octi hangs into view from above, still held by Bubbles.
Buttercup says: "Oh, I give up."
The owner of said octopus descends into view and picks up a crayon to start in on her coloring again. She seems rather distracted, however, and the crayon breaks in her hand. Cut to her sisters; she rises from the ground.
Bubbles says: "Stupid **TOWER COLLAPSING** crayon!"
This outburst has drawn the attention of the other two in a hurry.
Bubbles says: "That was my favorite color!"
Buttercup lets a block slip from her grasp, while Blossom forgets about her book altogether. Now Bubbles settles happily down to her work as her sisters approach during the next line.
Bubbles says: "Well, I guess my unicorn will have to be pink."
Buttercup says: "What was that you said?"
Blossom says: "Where did you learn that word?"
Bubbles says: "The Professor."
Bubbles says: "I think it’s pretty."
Buttercup says: "Yeah."
Buttercup says: "I don’t know what it means, but it sounds cool."
Blossom says: "It’s pretty obvious, isn’t it?"
Blossom says: "It’s gotta be an adjective."
Blossom says: "That’s used to lend emphasis to words."
Blossom says: "Like “great” or “fantastic."
Blossom says: "”  I’m guessing it can be used for good and bad things."
Bubbles and Buttercup smile at each other; back to Blossom.
Blossom says: "Like, you can say “great,” “super-great,” or **CAT YOWL** ”great."
Bubbles says: "Kitty?"
Buttercup says: "**DOG BARK** Cool!"
Bubbles says: "** BARK** That makes sense."
Buttercup says: "** BARK** That makes sense."
Blossom says: "**BARK** Trust me."
Blossom says: "I know what I’m **BARK** talking about."
Bubbles says: "I **BARK** love it!"
Buttercup says: "I wanna **YOWL** try it!"
Buttercup says: "Hey, I **BARK** did it!"
In an instant, they are circling the ceiling light fixture.
Girls says: "We love **BARK**!"
Girls says: "It’s such a great word!"
Girls says: "We love **BARK**!"
Girls says: "It’s such a great word!"
Girls says: "We love **BEDSPRINGS TWANG**!"
Girls says: "We love **TWANG**!"
They collapse on the mattress in a giggling heap. Fade to black.
Fade in to the exterior of Pokey Oaks Kindergarten during the day.
Ms. Keane says: "Okay, children."

Buttercup says: "Aw—"
Girls says: "—"
Girls says: "**SCHOOL BELL**!"
Everyone else is caught flat-footed by these words; Mitch Mitchellson is first to speak up.
Mitch says: "They said **BELL**!"
Ms. Keane gasps and faints. Snap to black.
Blossom says: "Ms."
Blossom says: "Keane?"
A horizontal crack splits the blank field and widens as if an eye were being opened—this is the teacher’s perspective as she regains consciousness. The view, of the worried girls, starts out a bit fuzzy but soon comes into focus.
Blossom says: "Ms."
Blossom says: "Keane, are you okay?"
Cut to just behind them, the camera pointing straight at Ms. Keane’s face. It takes her a moment to get herself entirely composed, and her first action is to point angrily o.c.
Ms. Keane says: "Corner!"
Blossom says: "What did we do?"
Ms. Keane says: "You know very well what you did."
Ms. Keane says: "The rest of you can go to recess."
Cheering kids rush past her. The girls, meanwhile, are in the aforementioned corner.
Bubbles says: "But, Ms."
Bubbles says: "Keane, what did we do?"
Ms. Keane says: "Zip it!"
Bubbles says: "So this is what a time-out is like."
Buttercup says: "Ah, you get used to it."
Blossom says: "It’s the hotline!"
Bubbles says: "But we’re in time-out, and Ms."
Bubbles says: "Keane says we have to stay here and think about what we’ve done."
Bubbles says: "I don’t know what that is, but—"
Buttercup says: "It’s go time, girls!"
The exterior of the building; they take off through the roof.
Bubbles says: "What about time-out?"
Blossom says: "What’s up, Mayor?"
Blossom says: "What’s the crisis?"
Blossom says: "Another monster on the loose?"
Blossom says: "Mojo Jojo?"
Blossom says: "Fuzzy Lumkins?"
Mayor says: "Girls, it’s a crisis of epic proportions."
Mayor says: "It’s lunchtime and I can’t open my pickle jar!"
He holds it up on the end of this line, then starts to shake it back and forth. The girls are irked.
Mayor says: "I mean, what’s a PB-and-J without a pickle, I tell you?"
Buttercup says: "The pickle jar, Mayor?"
Buttercup says: "The pickle jar?"
Buttercup says: "I can’t believe you called us here for this!"
Buttercup says: "I can’t **THROW DOWN; CRASH** believe this!"
Blossom says: "You’re such a **THROW DOWN; CRASH** baby!"
Bubbles says: "You’re not **THROW DOWN; CRASH** nice!"
Cut to behind the girls. The remains of the Mayor’s lunch are splattered across his desk.
Buttercup says: "What do you have to **MAYOR FALLS; THUMP** say for yourself?"
Mayor says: "Ms."
Mayor says: "Bellum, could you, uh, step in here a moment, please?"
Wipe to the girls in flight, with healthy dollops of foam around their mouths—the trusty assistant washed them out with soap. After a moment, they wipe the residue away.
Blossom says: "Blech!"
Bubbles says: "That was yucky!"
Buttercup says: "Yeah, what’s with all the **PASSING GEESE HONK** soap in the mouth?"

Thin robber says: "Fork it over, cupcake—"
Thin robber says: "or else!"
Blossom says: "Or else what?"
Cut to them, near the front entrance. A security guard sleeps in a nearby chair.
Blossom says: "It’s not **SNORE** nice to pick on the **SNORE** citizens of Townsville!"
Fat robber says: "Dude!"
Fat robber says: "Did she say what I think she said?"
Blossom says: "You’re a **PUNCH** man!"
Cut to a group of three other customers, man, woman, and boy, who are looking on. The two adults are flabbergasted, but the boy is smiling at the proceedings; however, the man promptly leans over and sticks his fingers in the youth’s ears. The latter is not happy about this. Bubbles and Buttercup start belting the fat robber back and forth.
Buttercup says: "That’ll teach you, **SMACK** meanie!"
Buttercup says: "Eat my **SMACK**!"
Bubbles says: "Yeah, you **SMACK**!"
Close-up of the teller, who now looks as if she wants to remove her ears and soak them in straight Lysol overnight.
Blossom says: "Leave these **SMACK** nice people alone!"

Buttercup says: "You want another **SMACK** one?"
Cut to the girls, who are looking up at the source of a growing shadow on the floor. The robbers drop into view and crash senseless to the floor.
Blossom says: "That’ll teach you!"
Cut to outside the bank entrance. Two cops stand by their cruiser, with cups of coffee in hand, and the girls address them. One is thin, the other fat. A construction worker is poised over his jackhammer in the fore.
Blossom says: "Hello, **JACKHAMMER** officers."
Blossom says: "The **JACKHAMMER** crooks are inside."
Blossom says: "Have a **JACKHAMMER** nice day."
Thin cop says: "You have a **JACKHAMMER** nice day too."
Cut to an old woman at a busy intersection. She begins to cross the street against a “don’t walk” signal and steps into the path of an oncoming truck. As the driver leans on his horn, the girls whisk her away and set her down safely on the sidewalk.
Blossom says: "There you go, ma’am."
Buttercup says: "Boy, you need to look out."
Buttercup says: "That **HONK** truck almost ran you over."
The old woman shudders at what she has just heard and swings her purse into Buttercup’s face.
Buttercup says: "Hey!"
Old woman says: "Why, you fresh little whippersnappers!"
Cut to Bubbles, up near a tree’s topmost branches. She has rescued a cat from its acrophobic perch and is carrying it down to ground level. Tilt down to follow her; we are in a girl’s backyard, and she is waiting eagerly for her pet Bubbles hands the animal over.
The girl starts wailing at the end of this bit of advice; Bubbles joins her sisters in midair.
Buttercup says: "What was everybody so mad about?"
Blossom says: "I don’t know."
Blossom says: "Everybody is acting so weird."
Bubbles says: "Do you hear that?"
Building level. Extreme close-up of the source of this yelling as it stalks across the screen and panicked screams rise from below. It is a gigantic toilet, with eyes near the flush handle and its seat cover partially open for a mouth. Sharp teeth ring the seat and cover. Back to the girls.
Bubbles says: "Holy **CRASH**!"
Bubbles says: "Somebody’s using our new word!"
Back to the rampaging monster, the camera pulled back a distance. Now we see that the toilet is only its head; the body is reptilian and colored in light shades of blue.
Narrator says: "Looks like the girls aren’t the only ones in town using colorful language."
Blossom says: "Let’s go, girls!"
Monster says: "Huh?"
Blossom says: "Hey, you!"
Blossom says: "Mr."
Blossom says: "Monster!"
Blossom says: "Where did you learn that word?"
The creature goes into an extended explanation, in like manner to its previous profanities. It seems to make sense to the girls, though.
Blossom says: "Interesting."
Blossom says: "I, uh, don’t know what some of those other words mean."
Buttercup says: "But they make you sound **HELICOPTER** tough!"
Cut to a street corner. As the monster curses a blue streak in the background and people run everywhere, a nun stands in the foreground and prays. From this vantage point, the monster’s tail is visible—a roll of toilet paper attached to the hindquarters, with a long streamer of the stuff dangling free. Pan from the nun to two hoodlums; one is big and muscular, while the other is undersized and has his hands over his ears.
Big hoodlum says: "Man!"
Big hoodlum says: "That’s some rough language!"
Bubbles says: "Connect **HONK** to **HONK** word and it becomes **HONK**."
A tattoo parlor, where a fellow is having some ink done. The unintelligible swearing is clearly audible even from in here, so much so that the artist stops his work and both men take notice.
Customer says: "That sure is naughty."
Blossom says: "It can also be used as a verb."
Buttercup says: "Yeah, like **HONK**."
Down in the street, two bikers are ready to put it in gear. One is a good bit older, judging from his white mustache.
Older biker says: "Let’s roll."
Older biker says: "I can’t take it no more."
Blossom says: "No."
Blossom says: "She wasn’t telling you to **HONK**!"
The monster disagrees vociferously—this is an argument with him. In a prison cell, an inmate clutches the bars.
Inmate says: "Make it stop!"
Inmate says: "My delicate ears can’t take it no more!"
Buttercup says: "And what if I did **HONK** mean it?"
Bubbles says: "Now you’re just being **HONK** rude!"
Buttercup says: "Well, we’re gonna **HONK**!"
Blossom says: "**HONK**!"
Bubbles says: "**HONK**!"
Cut to a slow pan across a group of totally speechless observers—all they can do is gasp in horror as the inaudible cursing continues—then to the girls and the monster. Pull back on this shot to frame more of the street, which is clogged with cars that are the source of the honking. The Professor is stuck in the traffic jam.
Professor says: "Oh, what the heck is the holdup?"
Professor says: "I’m never gonna make my three o’clock manicure."
Professor says: "What’s going on?"
He smiles at the sight of the girls confronting the monster.
Professor says: "Oh!"
Professor says: "It’s the girls!"
Blossom says: "Take that, you **HONK** monster!"
Buttercup says: "Eat my **HONK** fist!"
Bubbles says: "I’m gonna teach you a **HONK** lesson!"
Blossom says: "You **HONK** want another **HONK** taste of **HONK** me, **HONK**?"
Throughout the previous four lines, the Professor’s quiet pride in his girls gives way to shock and utter mortification. Cut to the girls and the monster; it shouts a few more unprintable things at them. The Professor, meanwhile, has got himself back under control, and he is not happy.
Professor says: "BLOSSOM!!"
Professor says: "BUTTERCUP!!"
Professor says: "BUBBLES!!"
Professor says: "GET DOWN HERE RIGHT NOW!!"
Back to the girls on the end of this line. They are spoiling for more action, but this summons snaps them out of it.
Girls says: "Professor?"
Blossom says: "Could you excuse us for just a second, Mr."
Blossom says: "Monster, sir?"
A grumbled reply, and they zip down. The creature stomps off to raise more of a ruckus.
Blossom says: "What’s going on, Professor?"
Buttercup says: "We’re a little busy."
Professor says: "I am very angry with all three of you."
Girls says: "What for?"
Professor says: "That word you’re using is not a good word."
Professor says: "It’s naughty."
Blossom says: "What word?"
Bubbles says: "We used a lot of words today."
Professor says: "You know—"
Professor says: "that one you keep using over and over."
Professor says: "Think real hard."
Buttercup says: "“The”?"
Bubbles says: "“You”?"
Blossom says: "We used both of those a lot."
Professor says: "No, not those."
Professor says: "Those are great."
Professor says: "It’s that other one."
Blossom says: "“Bad”?"
Blossom says: "That’s not good."
Blossom says: "Is that it?"
Professor says: "No, that new one."
Bubbles says: "Ohhh!"
Bubbles says: "You mean **HONK**!"
Bubbles says: "I learned that from you, Professor."
Professor says: "We just got cable."
He approaches the girls, who are now gathered by a stopped car, and forces a cheery tone into his voice—even though he knows exactly what started all the sailor talk.
Professor says: "Uh, I don’t know where you heard it, but it’s a naughty, naughty word!"
The crowd is nonplussed; he lowers his voice and turns back to the girls.
As he starts to whisper, cupping a hand to his mouth, they float in closer to hear more clearly. After a moment, their eyes go so wide that they look as if they might pop from the sockets.
Bubbles says: "Oh, no!"
Bubbles says: "I’m a potty-mouth!"
Buttercup says: "We have some unfinished business, girls!"
It is sitting on a building, grumbling and holding out one hand as if to say, “Bring it on, jerks.”.
Blossom says: "We need to teach that potty-mouth a lesson!"
The girls charge. Parked on the street is a big rig bearing the logo of the Super Sudsy Soap Co. This is hoisted away by Bubbles and Buttercup. Blossom rushes in and lands a blow to the monster’s midsection, causing it to let off a fresh string of foul language. Her sisters stuff the truck into the open mouth, after which it swirls down the spout as the toilet is flushed. Pink suds start to bubble over the sides of the bowl, and the creature—now looking rather ill—lets off a belch.
Blossom says: "That should be a lesson to you, Mr."
Blossom says: "Monster, that certain words are inappropriate."
Bubbles says: "Especially for nice girls like us."
Blossom says: "Now, you get a time-out to think about what you’ve done."
Cut to an unoccupied patch of land at an intersection. Two of its edges face the sidewalks, while the other two are formed by very tall buildings that stand nearby. The monster clumps into view, its back partially turned to the camera, and stands facing this “corner.”.
Buttercup says: "Less talking, more **HONK** thinking!"
The background for the end shot comes up.
Narrator says: "And soap once again the day is saved—"
(The girls appear says: "Blossom and Bubbles in their usual poses, Buttercup sulking with a fresh mouthful of soap spilling down her chin."
(The girls appear says: ")"
Narrator says: "—"
Narrator says: "thanks to the Potty-Mou—"
