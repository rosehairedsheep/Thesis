Narrator says: "The city of Townsville!"
Narrator says: "A city where villainy exists 24/7!"
Narrator says: "But don’t be alarmed, for the Powerpuff Girls always spring into action!"
An enormous pink creature, with a single horn on its head and accordion-like arms that end in square claws, rears up and roars. It begins to stomp down the street, tearing holes in the buildings. Cut to Blossom in flight; the monster stops short upon her arrival. She deals it a quick string of crushing blows, and it falls to the pavement in slow motion.
Narrator says: "Face it."
Narrator says: "These girls’ll clean their clocks!"
On the end of this line, zoom in on a clock that hangs over the street corner. Cut to a jewelry store whose front window has been smashed; an alarm screams through the night, and a masked robber flees the scene. He carries a bag of loot in one hand and fires a gun behind himself with the other. Buttercup dives in, ready for a flying kick, and lets him have it in spades. He collapses to the ground, with his left arm extended ahead of himself so that we can see his wristwatch. Zoom in on this during the next line.
Narrator says: "Watch as they wind up the crime every time!"
Cut to a barnyard in which a few cows are grazing contentedly. A flying saucer hovers above them. After a moment, an alien creature materializes on the ground; it looks very much like a fugitive from a bad sci-fi movie—short, huge head, bulging eyes, and the like. It holds a device of some sort in one hand. One of the cows takes sudden notice of the new arrival and starts running across the yard, with the alien close behind. The device is pointed at the animal’s hindquarters—a probe perhaps. Bubbles arrives on the scene and has no trouble beating the alien into submission; her last blow, a flying uppercut, propels it straight up to crash through the underside of the saucer. She grabs the edge of this and hurls it like a discus, sending it over a clock tower and out of sight.
On the next line, turn down to the base of the tower. Blossom and Buttercup stand in front of it, and Bubbles joins them.
Narrator says: "It’s a lucky stroke for us that these are no secondhand heroines that keep our city safe—"
Narrator says: "—"
Narrator says: "deep into the night and into the wee hours of the morning!"
The sky begins to lighten behind them-daybreak is coming.
Narrator says: "And on a school night, even."
Cut to the exterior of Pokey Oaks Kindergarten as they fly in.
Cut to Ms. Keane at the front of the classroom; she is teaching a bit of picture recognition. Next to her is an easel with a picture of a ball.
Ms. Keane says: "Class, can you tell me what this is a picture of?"
Class says: "BALL!"
Ms. Keane says: "Very good!"
Class says: "DOG!"
Ms. Keane says: "Very good."
The next picture she shows is one of an automobile engine. Various parts are labeled.
Class says: "A FOUR-STROKE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE!"
Ms. Keane says: "Very good!"
Now she shows a saw cutting through a log.
Ms. Keane says: "And this is a, is—"
The sound of snoring is her reason for trailing off, and she looks around herself in puzzlement to try to find its source. The bell, the hotline, the pencil sharpener, the butt of a fat kid, Twiggy the hamster—none of them are causing the interruption. Cut to a close-up of the girls, panning slowly across their desk. They are fast asleep and sawing toothpicks, with their heads down.
Ms. Keane regards them in surprise for a moment before grimacing and reaching for a book on the shelf. These slam flat onto the desk, startling them out of their nap in an instant. Each blurts out a random fact in hopes of being right on her last question.
Bubbles says: "George Washington!"
Blossom says: "Pi R-squared!"
Buttercup says: "Borscht!"
Everybody but a visibly irritated Ms. Keane laughs at them, but stop when she speaks.
Blossom says: "We’re sorry, Ms."
Blossom says: "Keane."
Blossom says: "We can’t help it."
Bubbles says: "We wouldn’t be so tired if we weren’t out every single night—"
Buttercup says: "—"
Buttercup says: "keeping Townsville safe from crime for you and its citizens."
Ms. Keane says: "Mmm…yes, well, that—"
Ms. Keane says: "that’s true, I did forget that part."
Ms. Keane says: "But that does not excuse you from your responsibilities at school!"
Bubbles says: "You’re right."
Buttercup says: "We’re sorry."
Blossom says: "It’ll never happen again."
All three girls begin to snore again; Ms. Keane eyes them warily.
Ms. Keane says: "No, it won’t."
Ms. Keane says: "It certainly won’t."
Fade to black.
Fade into the exterior of the girls’ house that afternoon as they float down to the front door.
Professor says: "Oh, hello, girls."
Professor says: "Home from school soOOOOOOO—"
On the end of this, he recoils as if seeing some unimaginable horror. The camera zooms in.
Professor says: "JUMPIN’ JEHOSAPHAT!"
Professor says: "WHAT THE HECK IS THAT?!"
Professor says: "!"
Professor says: "?!"
Professor says: "!"
He points down o.c. on the end of this line, and we see the cause of his terror—a note pinned to Blossom’s dress. It is nearly as big as she is. With shaking hands, he lifts it for a closer look.
Professor says: "NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!"

Ms. Keane says: "You’re next, Professor."
Inside, she walks across the room, clipboard in hand, and he follows. Now he is doing his best to smile cheerfully. They stop at one of the children’s desks. It has two chairs—one adult-sized, one child-sized—at opposite ends. Ms. Keane sits in the former; the Professor stands nervously by the latter.
Ms. Keane says: "Please."
Ms. Keane says: "Have a seat."
He does so, and she begins to write on her clipboard. He moves his leg and bumps the desk.
Professor says: "Oop, ah…sorry."
He sets it back in place and laughs nervously; she only nods and smiles. Now she goes back to her writing. Close-up of the Professor, panning to Ms. Keane and back. His smile gives way to a more anxious expression several seconds after the camera returns to him. Cut back to her; she underlines a piece of writing four times, after which we see the Professor drumming his hands on his knees. She continues writing, her polite little smile never leaving her face and her eyes never meeting his. He is much less composed, though, and sweat starts to pour from his forehead as his eyes dart back and forth. She jots down one more thing before finally looking up from the board and speaking—it has been just over forty seconds since she sat down. The Professor reacts to her voice as if it were a live electrical wire in his hand.
Ms. Keane says: "Well—"
Professor says: "I didn’t do it!"
Professor says: "Uh, um—"
Professor says: "you needed to speak to me about the girls?"
Ms. Keane says: "Yes, Professor."
Ms. Keane says: "I’m very concerned."
Ms. Keane says: "They’ve been falling asleep in class, and their participation is slipping."
Professor says: "Well, what do you suppose the reason is, Ms."
Professor says: "Keane?"
Ms. Keane says: "I believe all of this late-night crime-fighting is to blame."
Professor says: "Well, they are superheroes, you know, and saving the world’s a big responsibility."
Ms. Keane says: "But education is a bigger responsibility."
Professor says: "But—"
Professor says: "what do you propose?"
Ms. Keane says: "Well, I suggest you set…  …a curfew!"
Cut to the girls in their bedroom, looking up at the camera with shocked expressions.
Girls says: "A curfew?!"
Girls says: "!"
Girls says: "But, Professor that’s not fair!"
He is in the room with them; through the windows, we see that it is now dusk.
Professor says: "No buts, girls."
Professor says: "From now on, you’re to be home by 7:30."
Girls says: "7:30?!"
Girls says: "!"
Buttercup says: "But the juicy stuff doesn’t even start until at least 9:00!"
Bubbles says: "7:30 isn’t as dark as 9:00, though."
The hotline goes off, and the girls brace for action.
Blossom says: "The hotline!"
Blossom says: "Professor, we gotta go now."
Professor says: "Girls, don’t forget."
Professor says: "7:30."
Girls says: "We won’t."
Cut to the city skyline, which appears very much at ease—but not for long. Mojo Jojo floats up into view, holding a blaster and using a craft that consists of a glass-and-metal bubble with holes cut in it for his arms and legs. A propeller on top keeps him aloft. He flies over the city, firing shots in all directions; whatever happens to be in the path of the beam gets a neat hole cut all the way through it. One-shot takes out a store window and reveals a stunned deli clerk running out his store. Mojo now lands and lets loose with another barrage as people run in all directions; it is a total panic as Mojo has his way with Townsville. The Narrator screams in terror.
Narrator says: "Mojo is turning Townsville into swiss cheese!"
Man says: "Look, everyone!"
Man says: "It’s the Powerpuff Girls, here to save us!"
Narrator says: "You said it!"
Narrator says: "It’ll be a sight for our girls to cream that Mojo!"
Narrator says: "Things aren’t looking too goodja for you, Mojo!"
Narrator says: "So leave that Prov Alone and prepare to be shredded!"
Mojo takes off, his blaster at the ready. He and the girls charge toward a head-on confrontation; the camera cuts back and forth between the sides three times, zooming in each time, then pulls back to a long shot of the block as they approach. Before they meet, though, cut to the Professor at the front door of the house. He has his hand cupped to his mouth.
Professor says: "GIRLS!"
Professor says: "IT’S 7:30!"
Blossom says: "Sorry, Mojo, but we’ve gotta go now."
Bubbles says: "We’ve got school in the morning."
Buttercup says: "Yeah, we gotta be in bed by 7:30."
Professor says: "GIRLS!"
Narrator says: "Now what will happen to Townsville without its heroes to protect it?!"
Narrator says: "!"
Narrator says: "Oh, I Camembert to watch!"
Fade to black.
Snap to the girls, now dressed for bed and tucked in. They do not look happy.
Girls says: "But—"
Professor says: "No buts, girls!"
Professor says: "You’ve got school in the morning, and you need your rest."
Blossom says: "But what about Townsville?!"
Blossom says: "!"
Cut to one of the bedroom windows, in which the city is visible. The Professor leans into view next to it and smiles calmly.
Professor says: "Townsville’s fine."
Professor says: "Oh, just look at it."
Professor says: "So quiet, so peaceful."
He turns away from the window; the skyline instantly erupts in flames, and distant screams and sirens make themselves heard. However, he is completely oblivious to the new crisis.
Professor says: "Thanks to you, Townsville’s as safe as safe can be."
Back to the girls, who have been watching with their hands to their mouths.
Professor says: "—"
Professor says: "hop aboard the Dreamland Express."
Girls says: "But—"
Professor says: "Hop aboard the Dreamland Express!"
They instantly close their eyes, and he smiles.
Professor says: "That’s better."
The girls, now visible in the light from the windows, are wide awake and very dissatisfied. The Professor’s footsteps die away in the hall outside, after which more footsteps—many more, and large ones—approach the general area.
Blossom says: "You hear that?"

Back to the level of the windows.
Buttercup says: "Oh, no!"
Buttercup says: "It’s—"
Bubbles says: "A parade!"
Blossom says: "Not just any parade, Bubbles, but a parade of villainy."
Blossom says: "And it’s marching straight into Townsville!"
Cut to inside the room; she turns away from her window. The commotion dies away over the next few lines.
Blossom says: "PROFESSOR!"
Professor says: "Go to bed, girls!"
Buttercup says: "Oh, this makes me sick to my stomach!"
Buttercup says: "What are we gonna do?"
Blossom says: "There’s nothing we can do."
Blossom says: "Except try to go to sleep and hope that Townsville is still there in the morning."
Bubbles says: "That’s it?"
Bubbles says: "The parade’s over?"
Bubbles says: "Where’s the floats?"
Bubbles says: "Where’s the giant 3-D cartoon character endorsement balloons?"
On the end of this, the eye of the giant reptile appears at the window. The beast roars; Bubbles manages a terrified squeal—her pigtails standing on end as they did in “Insect Inside”—and dives under the covers, landing in her section of the bed.
Girls says: "PROFESSOR!!"
Professor says: "GO TO SLEEP!!!!"
They sit in stunned silence for a moment, but the buzzing of the hotline puts smiles on their faces as the camera pulls back to show it. The Professor is about to settle into his favorite chair when he catches wind of it, realizing it is the last thing he needs to remove to ensure the girls obey the agreement he made with Ms. Keane and follow through on the curfew. In the room, Blossom has picked up the call.
Blossom says: "Yes, Mayor…Okay."
Blossom says: "We’ll be right the—"
A rectangle of light falls across the room, with the Professor’s shadow visible within it—he is checking on them and caught them red-handed disobeying the curfew. Blossom quickly changes gears.
Blossom says: "Uh…  No thanks, we’re not interested in buying the paper, thank you."
Cut to the exterior of the house; we see flashes of light in the bedroom windows and hear crackling sparks and the hotline’s buzzer, ending with a snap. Inside, the Professor leaves the room, with the disconnected phone in his hands. The severed cord still sparks and snaps. The girls watch him go in shocked silence.
Professor says: "Good night, girls."
Wipe to him downstairs, relaxing by the fire. He has his feet up and the paper in his hands and he looks quite content—peace and quiet at last, and the Girls finally obeying their curfew and going to sleep with nothing else to prevent them from doing so and violating the curfew in the process.
(He starts to read the paper says: "“TOWNSVILLE DOOMED!!"
but his face almost immediately goes slack at what he sees—a front-page photo of the burning city says: "“TOWNSVILLE DOOMED!!"
with a two-word banner headline says: "“TOWNSVILLE DOOMED!!"
(He starts to read the paper says: "” The paper is promptly crumpled up and thrown into the fireplace; the Professor sits frozen for a moment, chewing his lower lip, anxious about possibly going back on reinforcing the curfew suggested by Ms."

Announcer 1 says: "We interrupt this program for this special bulletin."
Radio reporter says: "We need the Power—"
She trails off into unintelligible noise as if her report was being played from a phonograph record on a slowing turntable. The Professor hunches his head down between his shoulders for a moment, more anxious than ever about disobeying Ms. Keane after hearing another report of Townsville being in trouble, before coming up with a remote control. He turns the TV on with this and gets a nature program—a lion chasing an antelope. A forced, frozen grin gives way to a relaxed smile.
Close-up of his hand. He strikes a match and lifts it to his pipe as a news report breaks in.
Announcer 2 says: "We interrupt this program for this special report."
On screen, a reporter stands before a group of burning buildings.
TV reporter 1 says: "Help!"
TV reporter 1 says: "Townsville’s burning down!"
Back to the Professor; the pipe shoots from his mouth in shock as he once again finds himself faced with sending the girls out past curfew by another panicked news report of the city in trouble.
TV reporter 1 says: "Things are looking—"
He changes channels and hits an opera performance. This soothes him.
Another news flash. This time, two monsters are ravaging the city behind the reporter.
TV reporter 2 says: "Townsville’s being eaten!"
A channel change, another report, with flying saucers, blasting the buildings.
TV reporter 3 says: "Townsville’s being invaded!"
Back to the Professor; he switches channels, but only hears more reports of chaos and pleas for the Girls to save Townsville; zoom on him with each change. He is growing increasingly frantic.
Various reporters says: "Rioting!"
Various reporters says: "…Mayhem!"
Various reporters says: "…Utter annihilation!"
Various reporters says: "…El muerte!"
[Note says: "This last is grammatically incorrect."
[Note says: "In Spanish, “muerte”—"
[Note says: "the word for death—"
[Note says: "is a feminine noun, which means it takes the definite article “la."
[Note says: "” “El” is the article for the masculine nouns."
Zoom in one more time—now we are at an extreme close-up of his eyes. The next reporter we hear is very calm, so much so that he could be mistaken for dead, given the broadcasts that have just been heard.
TV reporter 4 says: "Up next, the current time."
(Now he is seen on the TV screen—white button-down shirt says: "a white box with the word “TIME” on it in black letters."
bow tie says: "a white box with the word “TIME” on it in black letters."
square glasses says: "a white box with the word “TIME” on it in black letters."

TV reporter 4 says: "I’m Sonny Dial, here to bring you the latest time."
TV reporter 4 says: "But first, I hope all of you remembered that last night was Daylight Savings, which means everyone sets their clocks back by one hour."
TV reporter 4 says: "That makes our current time 6:41."
TV reporter 4 says: "I’ll be back at 6:42 with the up-to-the-minute time."
(This bit of news hits the Professor like a baseball bat to the head as his face is now frozen in dumbfounded shock at this sharp turn of events after everything he just did to either get the girls to go to sleep or ignore the danger Townsville was in without the girls to save it. He looks around the room; every timepiece he sees says: "41."

Professor says: "Crikey!"
Professor says: "I forgot to set the clocks back!"
Cut to inside the girls’ bedroom. With the horrible realization that he forgot to reset the clocks an hour back, he kicks the door open, turns on the lights, and dashes over to the bed. However, by this point, they are fast asleep.
Professor says: "Get out of bed!"
Professor says: "Now!"
He flips the mattress, dumping the girls onto the floor and waking them up in the process, and jumps over to them.
Professor says: "Daylight Savings…clocks wrong…45 minutes, save Townsville now!"
Blossom says: "But what about our curfew?"
Professor says: "No time!"
Professor says: "Go!"
Professor says: "Go!"
Professor says: "Go!"
On each “Go!” he throws one girl o.c. as hard as he can. Blossom is first, then Buttercup, and finally Bubbles. They crash through the bedroom wall. He pants for a moment, then runs out and skids back to his chair. Picking up a fresh copy of the paper after he threw the old one into the fireplace, he is greeted by the headline “TOWNSVILLE SAVED!!” above a photo of the restored skyline. He grabs the radio out of the fire and shakes it, and it begins to work again despite the flames licking at its housing.
Radio reporter says: "And so, in a flurry of Powerpuffery, the city of Townsville seems to be getting back to normal."
He smiles upon hearing this and leans toward the TV for more good news. He switches to the first reporter, behind whom the girls are working so fast that they appear only as light blurs, and the reporter now has a happy, relieved look on his face compared to his frantic one from earlier.
TV reporter 1 says: "Townsville is saved once again!"
Extreme close-up of the Professor’s eyes, pulling back as he switches channels. Now a look of shaken relief is on his face as every channel he turns to now report good news rather than bad news like earlier.
Professor says: "Ahh, that’s my girls."
Narrator says: "It sure is nice to have the girls to fall back on, eh, Professor?"
The background for the end shot comes up.
Narrator says: "And so once again the day is saved—"
Benjamin Franklin appears, holding a pocket watch by its chain between two fingers.
Narrator says: "—"
Narrator says: "thanks to Benjamin Franklin’s suggestion of setting clocks back during the winter for extra daylight to conserve economic spending on candles—"
He is replaced by the girls in their usual pose.
Narrator says: "—"
Narrator says: "and the Powerpuff Girls!"
