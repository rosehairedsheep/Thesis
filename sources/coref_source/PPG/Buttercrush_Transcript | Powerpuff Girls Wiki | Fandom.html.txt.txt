Narrator says: "The city of Townsville."
Narrator says: "A pleasant place to live."
Narrator says: "Unless you run into—"
Cut to five green-skinned, disreputable-looking fellows walking down the street. On one side, one is a dwarf who looks as if he just jumped out of a Picasso painting; another is big and fat, with a shock of orange hair covering the top half of his face. On the other side are a bug-eyed hunchback with an enormous chin, ragged clothes, and a long tongue hanging out and, behind him, a skinny guy with a long, pointed nose and a cap turned backward. The one in the center is tall and slim, has straight, greasy hair and a scraggly mustache. He wears sunglasses and a life-preserver jacket.
Narrator says: "—"
Narrator says: "the Gangreen Gang!"
Narrator says: "The biggest bunch of belligerent bullies this town’s ever seen!"
They continue along the street for several seconds; cut to a dodgeball lying on the ground in the park. The Gang walks into view from the right; all except the one with the shades keep going until they move o.c. left. He stops at the ball and clears his throat loudly, and the others back up to join him. When he speaks, he sounds like your typical juvenile delinquent—mean and disrespectful.
Shades wearer says: "Well, well!"
Shades wearer says: "What do we have here?"
He picks the ball up and holds it. Three little kids come up and look up at the group pleadingly.
Kid says: "Excuse me, mister…but…can we have our ball back?"
Shades wearer says: "Mister?"
Shades wearer says: "Um, Lil' Arturo, is your name Mister?"
Lil' Arturo sounds very much like Señor Wences when he opens his mouth. He laughs for a moment, then cuts himself off sharply.
Lil' Arturo says: "No."
Ace says: "How ’bout you, Big Billy?"
As soon as Big Billy speaks, it instantly becomes clear that he will never get into MIT.
Billy says: "Duh—"
Billy says: "no."
Ace says: "Grubber?"
Grubber says: "Pbbbbpppppbbbbbt!"
Ace says: "Yeah, I thought so."
Ace says: "Hey, is your name Mister, Snake?"
Snake speaks with a pronounced hiss and a forked tongue.
Snake says: "I mean no."
Ace says: "Sorry."
Ace says: "You three are way off track."
Kid says: "Well…can we have our ball back anyway?"
Ace says: "Oh, sure."
Ace says: "Why not?"
Instead of handing the ball back, he bounces it off the faces of all three of them, knocking them to the ground. They lie shaking fearfully in the Gang’s shadows.
Ace says: "Hey, boys!"
Snake says: "What is it, Ace?"
Arturo says: "What is it, Ace?"
Billy says: "What is it, Ace?"
Ace says: "I don’t think these kids are havin’ fun."
Lil' Arturo says: "You want us to show them how to have fun?"
Ace says: "Yes, Lil' Arturo."
Ace says: "Let’s show them how to have fun…Gangrene style!"
Snake grabs hold of a merry-go-round with two kids on it and spins hard, sending them flying. Grubber sinks his teeth into a tire swing and shakes it and its occupant back and forth like a dog worrying a bedroom slipper. A jungle gym is crushed when Big Billy falls on it.
Big Billy says: "Jungle gym."
Lil' Arturo is in the sandbox with a kid.
Lil' Arturo says: "Hey, look at this!"
He throws sand into the kid’s face, causing him to cry. A girl on the swing set suddenly finds herself in Ace’s hands. He pushes hard enough to wrap the swing’s ropes around the top crossbar and tie her to it. Close-up of a kid playing with a toy airplane; a hand—Snake’s—reaches into view and gives him an incredibly painful wedgie. He is hauled into the air, screaming for mercy and getting none. Pull back to show the entire Gang laughing over this and the rest of the chaos they have caused.
Wedgie kid says: "The Powerpuff Girls!"
Cut to the girls, looking very upset with the situation, then shift to each Gang member in sequence.
Arturo says: "The Powerpuff Girls?"
Billy says: "The Powerpuff Girls?"
Snake says: "The P-P-Powerpuff Girls-s-s?"
Grubber says: "Pbbbbpppbbbt?"
Ace says: "The Powerpuff Girls?"
Ace says: "Snake!"
Ace says: "What are you doing to that poor child?!"
Ace says: "!"
Snake says: "But—"
Snake says: "but—"
Snake says: "you-s-s said—"
The tension is broken by soft giggling from Buttercup. Close-up of her behind Blossom’s shoulder. Pan slightly left to bring her into view; she glares back at her sister.
Blossom says: "Buttercup!"
Buttercup’s expression hardens as Blossom looks disapprovingly back at her, still wary of her laughing at Ace punching Snake in an attempt to save face with the Girls. Close-up of Ace, looking rather perplexed by all this. After a moment, a sly smile spreads itself across his face. He just had a great idea. Pull back; he steps up to address the girls.
Ace says: "—"
Ace says: "please forgive my foolish friend for his foolish act."
Ace says: "For he did not know what he was doin’."
Close-up of the girls, panning across as he continues. Bubbles and Blossom are still angry, but Buttercup is smiling with tears in her eyes.
Ace says: "Please?"
Pull back. Buttercup looks beseechingly at her sisters, who still seem unconvinced. Long pause.
Blossom says: "Okay."
Buttercup smiles at Ace. Extreme close-up of him again as he tips his shades.
Ace says: "Thank you."
Narrator says: "Oh, no!"
Narrator says: "Looks like Buttercup is looking for love in all the wrong places."
Cut to the city skyline.
Narrator says: "Next day…  Townsville Museum of Natural History."
Inside, a guard is leading the Pokey Oaks kindergarten teacher and her students around the galleries. The girls float along at the back of the group.
Narrator says: "Oh, look!"
Narrator says: "The Pokey Oaks  …the Gangreen Gang?!"
Narrator says: "!"
Narrator says: "This can’t be good."
Side view of a painting on the wall. The camera shakes as Billy walks into view and starts throwing punches at something o.c. right. Pieces of debris fly back at him. Cut to behind him; what he has been assaulting is a soda machine.
Snake says: "I think she needs moneys-s-s."
Arturo says: "This Mesopotamian vase is probably worth a couple of bucks."
Extreme close-up of the coin slot.
Ace says: "Slip it in right here, Arturo."
Side view of the machine; Arturo walks into view, carrying the vase over his head, and smashes it against the slot. Back to the tour group; the camera shakes. The girls turn around to look; back to the Gang. Arturo is now holding a mummy and making as if to insert it.
Ace says: "Now this has gotta be worth at least one soda."
Once again Buttercup’s fierce expression melts into affection.
Blossom says: "All right, girls."
Blossom says: "Let’s show these creeps how to respect other people’s property!"
She and Bubbles start laying into the four underlings. Cut to Buttercup, who watches the pounding as it goes on o.c. Ace steps into view.
Ace says: "Hey."
Ace says: "Buttercup, how come you guys always pick on us, huh?"
Pull back; in the foreground, Blossom and Bubbles are kicking Arturo back and forth. Close-up of Ace and Buttercup again.
Ace says: "W-We was only tryin’ to get a soda."
She flies to a hanging tapestry and pulls it off the wall, then carries it back to the fight. She drops it over the combatants as if smothering a fire with a blanket; they continue brawling underneath. Ace stands up and whistles and his four buddies poke their heads out from the edge of the tapestry and pull free to join him.
Ace says: "Come on, guys, let’s am-scray!"
The others walk o.c.; before Ace can follow them, Buttercup flies up behind him and taps him on the shoulder. He turns around to find her smiling shyly at him.
Ace says: "Hey?"
She produces a can of soda from behind her back and holds it out to him. He takes it and tips his shades.
Ace says: "You know, kid?"
Ace says: "You’re not so bad."
Ace says: "You can hang out with us anytime."
Cut to the exterior of the girls’ house at night.
Inside, the girls are fast asleep. Zoom in slowly. After some moments, Buttercup opens one eye and looks over at her sisters to make sure they are not waking up.
Narrator says: "Oh, no!"
She gets out of bed and tiptoes across the bedroom.
Narrator says: "She isn’t!"
She reaches the window and opens it.
Narrator says: "She is."
She climbs through and closes the window. Cut to the outside it and follow her as she flies across the city.
Narrator says: "I hope she knows what she’s doing."
Stop on the Townsville Dump, its incinerator visible in the distance. Buttercup lands amid the mountains of garbage, looks around herself nervously, then flies o.c. Pan across the dump to a green shack; she lands in front of its door and knocks. Cut to behind her on the porch. There is no sound but the chuffing of the incinerator. The door opens, revealing Ace’s feet inside; turn up to his head.
Ace says: "Hey."
His perspective of Buttercup, looking up and smiling. Back to him. The other Gang members quickly gather behind him. They are visibly nervous.
Snake says: "W-W-W-What-What she’s doing here-s-s, Boss-s-s?!"
Snake says: "!"
Ace says: "Back up!"
Ace says: "Relax!"
They instantly collapse to the floor. Billy reads a book while Grubber plays the violin. Cut to outside the door, the camera pointing in.
Ace says: "Buttercup."
Ace says: "Please, come in."
She floats up to his eye level; the door closes on them. Dissolve to inside the shack, where Billy is seated at a table with his back to the camera. He looks right o.c. Pan in that direction to show Arturo seated across from him, then Grubber and finally a very worried Snake next to Buttercup. Except for the crickets chirping, there is silence. Snake breaks this after a long moment; pan right slightly to bring Ace into view on Buttercup’s other side.
Ace says: "Sweet move, Buttercup."
Snake says: "Yes."
Snake says: "Please."
Snake says: "Hang out."
Dissolve to the Gang pounding on a junked car. Billy punches at the hood, Arturo jumps on the roof, and Snake fools around behind the wheel. Pan to the rear end, where Ace is getting ready to hit the car with a bat. He does so a couple of times and then offers a chance to Buttercup, who is standing next to him. She jumps in front of Snake, holding the bat; he tries desperately to wave her off, but she pays no mind. She hits the car; the others watch as it sails over the horizon, carrying Snake.
Dissolve to the Gang and Buttercup, clustered around some piece of work. When they back away, laughing, we see that they have tied paper bags onto the feet of a hapless alley cat. It shakes its paws and looks pitifully at the camera. Cut to Snake, being hit alternately by Ace and Buttercup and bobbing back and forth like a punching bag. The camera pans quickly from side to side to follow them.
Cut to Ace and Buttercup, bouncing into view and then falling o.c. again. Turn down to show them jumping on Billy’s gut, using it for a trampoline. Dissolve to a long shot of the shack; the moon sets and the sun rises to the laughter of the Gang. Close-up of the door as it swings open, showing them and Buttercup.
[Note says: "Until the sunrise occurs, this sequence plays out as a sort of silent movie."
Ace says: "Oh, Buttercup!"
Everybody except Ace waves goodbye and calls after her. This goes on for some moments before he rounds on them, suddenly very angry.
Ace says: "Shut up!"
Billy says: "Gee, Boss, we’s was just sayin’ goodbye to our new best friend."
Ace says: "She is not your new best friend!"
Snake says: "Hey, then why did we hang out with her, Boss-s-s?"
Ace says: "Don’t you realize that with Buttercup on our side…WE COULD CONTROL TOWNSVILLE?!"
Ace says: "!"
Arturo says: "Gee, Ace, what about her sisters?"
Ace says: "Sit for a spell, fellas, ’cause I’ve got a plan."
Pull back to show the shack, its door now closed and no one outside. As the Narrator speaks, the sun sets and the moon rises.
Narrator says: "Well, that sounds awful!"
Narrator says: "Evil people with evil plans?"
Narrator says: "I hope the Powerpuff Girls can get out of this one—"
Narrator says: "—"
Narrator says: "especially Buttercup!"
Inside, Ace is addressing the Gang.
Ace says: "She’ll be here any minute."
Ace says: "You all remember what to do?"
Snake, Arturo, and Grubber wink. If Billy does the same, his hair hides it. A knock is heard.
Ace says: "Showtime!"
Cut to just behind Buttercup, the camera pointing up at the door. Ace opens it.
Ace says: "Hey."
Ace says: "Please, come in."
She floats inside and lands in front of the Gang. There is a long silence, which is broken by Ace clearing his throat. The others react to his cue, walking past o.c.
Snake says: "Huh?"
Snake says: "Oh, right."
Snake says: "See you two a little bit laters-s-s."
Ace says: "They’ll be back..."
Ace says: "with pizza!"
Cut to the girls’ bedroom, where Bubbles and Blossom are fast asleep and snoring softly, then to Grubber at a pay phone. His raspberries sound as if he is laughing. Pull back to show Snake, Billy, and Arturo around him.
Snake says: "Come on, s-s-stop laughing!"
Snake says: "Do it rights-s-s!"
Back to the bedroom. A telephone rings o.c., rousing the two girls from sleep.
Blossom says: "Bubbles…get the phone."
Pan left slightly to show the phone on the nightstand by Bubbles’ side of the bed. She picks up the receiver.
Bubbles says: "Hello?"
Back to Grubber. He clears his throat a few times before speaking.
Bubbles says: "BUTTERCUP’S IN TROUBLE!!!"
This wakes Blossom up in an instant. We see the two girls in flight, then at the dump, looking around warily. A conveyor belt stretches across the screen behind them. Zoom in between them; Buttercup’s figure is on the conveyor, facing away from the camera. Its arms are tinted green, indicating it could be a member of the Gangrene Gang in disguise.
Grubber says: "Help me!"
Grubber says: "Help me!"
Grubber says: "My foot is stuck!"
Blossom and Bubbles land next to the figure and reach out to pull it loose.
Blossom says: "Don’t worry, Buttercup."
Bubbles says: "We’ve got you!"
The figure stands up and turns around—it is Grubber in a Buttercup dress, with his hair done up to match hers. He has lured Buttercup's sisters right into the Gang's trap.
Grubber says: "Pbbbbbppppt!"
Narrator says: "That’s not Buttercup!"
Cut to Snake at the controls of a machine. He pulls a lever; outside, two cars are released from an electromagnet attached to a crane and plummet toward the ground. The girls take notice just before the cars land on top of them; we see their heads poking from the roofs. Now the conveyor begins to move, carrying them screaming toward a large piece of equipment with pounding pistons and flames glowing inside. Close-up of them as they emerge; the cars have been crushed into cubes, rendering the two girls paralyzed and unable to move. Back to Snake at the controls.
Snake says: "S-S-Say goodbye, Powerpuffssss."
As the Narrator speaks, the girls reach the end of the conveyor and are pulled onto the electromagnet, now over their heads. They stick to it upside down.
Narrator says: "This is unbelievable!"
Narrator says: "Is this the end of our beloved girls?"
As he continues, the crane swings them, still screaming, over to a vat of molten steel and begins to lower them toward it.
Narrator says: "Can no one save our heroes from this impending doom?"
Narrator says: "Can Buttercup not hear her sisters’ cries for help?"
Inside the shack, the stereo is cranked to top volume. Heavy metal blasts from all the speakers; the two girls’ screams can be heard only faintly through the noise. Buttercup is dancing like crazy—she could easily hold her own in a mosh pit—while Ace throws the bullhorns.
Narrator says: "Oh, no!"
Narrator says: "Blossom and Bubbles’ screams are being drowned out by this rogue Romeo’s rambunctious rock!"
Inside, Buttercup watches Ace thrash and kick about, then does the same herself. In doing so, she knocks a hole in the wall of the shack. The music stops abruptly, and the screams can now be clearly heard. She starts in surprise; cut to outside the hole and pull back to show the other girls now in her line of sight. Ace takes no notice. Close-up of her, infatuation giving way to pure anger on her face; pull back to bring a very uneasy Ace into view next to her.
Ace says: "Aren’t we havin’ fun?"
Outside, she flies through the hole in the wall. Cut to Snake at the controls.
Snake says: "Adios-s-s, dos amigos-s-s!"
The crushed cars fall free of the electromagnet, carrying their screaming prisoners toward the boiling metal. Just before they splash down, Buttercup flies in and carries them to safety. She sets the cubes on the ground, and hatred and revenge write themselves all over her face. Cut to the Gang, looking very nervous; Ace ducks around behind the others.
Ace says: "Now listen, Buttercup, it’s not what you think!"
She charges in; with a single blow, she lays the four out flat. Now she moves in on Ace.
Ace says: "Buttercup, I’m innocent!"
Ace says: "The boys, they put me up to it!"
Ace says: "Honest!"
She lets him have it over and over again, including a flying kick that gives him a bloody nose. To finish him off, she backs up and delivers a crushing punch; Ace falls backward, his face reduced to pulp. His shades fly off and sail through the air in slow motion, finally landing in front of the girls. Long silence.
Blossom says: "Buttercup…what’s been going on?"
Another long silence. Finally, Buttercup hangs her head.
Buttercup says: "I’m sorry."
Narrator says: "Aww, we forgive you, Buttercup."
The standard end shot comes up.
Narrator says: "And so, once again, the day is saved, thanks to the Powerpuff Girls."
Narrator says: "The End!"
Narrator says: "We’ll see you again soon!"
