Theme Song.
The Powerpuff Girls' house, decorated in Christmas lights everywhere, at the exterior, appears.
Blossom crosses out the 24th of December with an X in red marker.
Blossom says: "Tomorrow's the day, girls."
Blossom says: "You know what that means."
Buttercup says: "Christmas!"
Bubbles says: "Christmas!"
Blossom says: "That's right!"
Blossom says: "It's time."
Blossom says: "Get..."
Blossom says: "the chest."
Buttercup and Bubbles rapidly gets the said chest and puts it on their bed.
Buttercup says: "Chest required."
All 3 Girls stand in front of the chest.
Blossom says: "Okay, now take out your keys."
As Blossom shows her pink heart key and Buttercup shows her green skull key, Bubbles takes out car keys.
Blossom says: "Uh, Bubbles, those are the Professor's car keys."
Bubbles says: "Oops."
Outside of the house, the Professor is having no luck opening the car, which has antlers and a red nose, with Bubbles' cat key Hmm, why won't this open?
Bubbles says: "Thanks, Professor."
Professor says: "Ah."
Bubbles is back standing on the bed with her sisters.
Blossom says: "All right, on the count of three."
Blossom says: "One, two, three!"
Buttercup says: "It's the perfect Christmas present for the Professor."
Blossom says: "Just think."
Blossom says: "Every time he drinks his morning coffee, he will be reminded that he is indeed the #1 Dad."
Bubbles says: "Ooh, and since we saved up all our allowance for it, maybe Santa will give us something special."
Buttercup says: "Yeah, like..."
Buttercup says: "A super sonic water soaker!"
Bubbles says: "Or..."
Bubbles says: "A squid for Octi to play with."
Buttercup says: "Ah, yeah!"
Buttercup says: "Santa's gonna put us on the nice list for sure now!"
Blossom says: "Ah, well, girls, you know Santa's not, you know..."
Bubbles says: "Santa's not what?"
Buttercup says: "Santa's not what?"
Blossom says: "Santa's not actually..."
Blossom says: "a real thing."
Bubbles says: "What?!"
Buttercup says: "What?!"
Bubbles says: "!"
Buttercup says: "!"
Buttercup says: "You take that back!"
Buttercup says: "Santa is real!"
They land back onto the bed.
Bubbles says: "Yeah!"
Blossom says: "Well, I mean, don't you think  it's a little outrageous that there's a guy who lives at the North Pole who is able to deliver presents to billions of kids across the world in one night?"
Bubbles says: "Hmm."
Buttercup says: "Hmm."
Bubbles says: "No."
Buttercup says: "No."
Bubbles says: "Blossom, how could you not believe in Santa?"
Blossom says: "I'm sorry, girls, but I just kind of believe in things with evidence."
Blossom says: "Like this mug, which we should wrap for the Professor."
Blossom says: "Hey!"
Buttercup says: "No way!"
Buttercup says: "Santa unbelievers don't get to wrap gifts!"
Bubbles says: "Yeah!"
Bubbles says: "He might see you and think we're naughty too!"
Bubbles says: "That wasn't naughtiness!"
Buttercup says: "We'll wrap the Professor's present!"
Blossom says: "Girls, don't be silly."
Buttercup says: "Hmm!"
Blossom says: "Let go!"
Bubbles says: "You let go!"
Buttercup says: "You let go!"
Their grudge on the mug trying to take it back from each other sends it flying into the sky in their room in the middle of both sides.
Buttercup says: "Look at what your unbelieving did, Blossom!"
Bubbles says: "We're for sure on the naughty list now."
Blossom says: "Look, if we rush to the store, maybe we can find another one before it closes."
Buttercup says: "Seriously?"
Buttercup says: "What are the odds that there even is another #1 Dad mug  when there's only one number one Dad?"
Blossom says: "We have to at least try."
Bubbles says: "You're right, it's what Santa would want."
A store called Clumpkins appears in the screen.
Guy In A Santa Outfit says: "Ho-ho-ho!"
Guy In A Santa Outfit says: "Welcome to Clumpkins Department Store."
The 3 Girls in their pink, blue, and green streaks, fly into the store in their Powerpuff Girls outfits.
Blossom says: "Stand aside, citizens, and direct us to your mugs."
Billy says: "Aisle 4."
The 3 Girls says: "Thank you!"
Blossom says: "All right, girls!"
Blossom says: "Hopefully, there's one more #1 Dad mug!"
A #1 Dad mug smashes into the ground, breaking, which startles all of them looking at Morbucks and her Kash Money Crew.
Morbucks says: "Tis' the season to make funny."
Morbucks says: "Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la."
Morbucks says: "Smash and thrash because it's funny."
Morbucks says: "Hahahahahahahaha."
Green Haired Boy With Rapper Glasses says: "You got mug dropped!"
Blossom says: "Get her, girls!"
Bubbles and Buttercup try to fly towards Morbucks, but Billy holds their necklines on the back of their shirts, holding them back as Buttercup tries to fight back on his grip.
Billy says: "Oh, no, you don't."
Bubbles says: "Hi, Billy."
Billy says: "No attacking the customers."
Morbucks says: "That's right, I bought all the mugs."
Morbucks says: "Just so I can destroy them."
Morbucks says: "I love the Christmas spirit."
Morbucks says: "Hyah!"
Buttercup says: "Look, Morbucks, why don't you give us one of those mugs,  and we'll put in a good word with Santa and get you off the naughty list?"
Morbucks says: "You kidding me?"
Morbucks says: "I wanna be on the naughty list."
Morbucks says: "That way Santa gets you coal."
Bubbles says: "You want coal?"
Morbucks says: "That's right."
Morbucks says: "With enough pressure, coal turns into diamonds."
Blossom says: "Wait, Morbucks, you believe in Santa too?"
Morbucks says: "Um, yeah."
Morbucks says: "I'm not a monster."
Morbucks says: "Hyah!"
Morbucks says: "Tis the season to be funny."
Morbucks says: "Fa, la, la, la, la, la, la, la."
Bubbles says: "Bye, Billy."
Blossom says: "I can't believe Morbucks would use economics so cruelly."
Bubbles says: "Well, I can't believe you don't believe in Santa."
Blossom says: "It's just that Santa's entire existence is so irrational."
Blossom says: "How does he pay for all of his elves?"
Bubbles says: "In magic, duh."
Buttercup says: "In magic, duh."
Blossom says: "Come on."
All 3 of them in their signature colored streaks fly fast enough to enter another Clumpkins store right past Cindy.
Cindy says: "Huh?"
Cindy says: "Hoo!"
The money cost appears on the register.
Elderly Lady says: "I'm not paying for that."
Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup fly to a shelf and finds a mug there.
Blossom says: "There's one mug left."
Buttercup says: "We did it!"
Bubbles says: "Christmas is saved!"
Blossom says: "Let's go home and wrap this before..."
Blossom says: "Huh?"
The flinging drum stick that broke the mug flings back into Mojo Jojo's hand, dressed as a drummer.
Mojo Jojo says: "Not so fast, Punypuffs!"
Mojo Jojo says: "It is I, Little Drummer Mojo, here to destroy you."
Cindy says: "Hey, watch it, kid, that's valuable inventory."
Blossom says: "Excuse me, but do you have any more #1 Dad mugs?"
Bubbles says: "It's for our number one dad."
Cindy says: "Sorry, we're sold out."
Cindy says: "You can try the Clumpkins outlet store on the edge of town."
Cindy says: "But you better hurry, it closes in 5 minutes."
Blossom says: "Thanks, Cindy!"
Bubbles says: "Thanks, Cindy!"
Buttercup says: "Thanks, Cindy!"
Cindy quickly dodges them as they fly out of the store at a fast pace.
The 3 Girls go back to flying.
Buttercup says: "I bet you wish you had Santa's rocket-powered sled now."
Blossom says: "Ugh, enough with the Santa stuff!"
Something hits all 3 of them, who are wearing Christmas sweaters, explodes as they fall onto the road.
Bubbles says: "Oh, no, Santa heard Blossom doesn't believe in him, and he's taking his revenge!"
Blossom says: "By giving us tacky sweaters?"
Buttercup says: "I don't know."
Buttercup says: "I think Santa's got some pretty good taste."
Bianca says: "Hey, Tackypuff Girls!"
Blossom says: "The Fashionistas?!"
Bubbles says: "The Fashionistas?!"
Buttercup says: "The Fashionistas?!"
Blossom says: "!"
Bubbles says: "!"
Buttercup says: "!"
Bianca says: "That's right."
Bianca says: "Now, get ready to be obliterated by our ugly holiday sweater cannon!"
Bianca says: "I don't know, Barbie."
Bianca says: "Where did they go?"
Blossom says: "We don't have time for this."
Blossom says: "2 minutes until the store closes!"
Buttercup says: "Step on it!"
Man Boy says: "No way!"
Man Boy says: "You should roll with it."
Blossom says: "Man Boy?!"
Bubbles says: "Man Boy?!"
Buttercup says: "Man Boy?!"
Blossom says: "!"
Bubbles says: "!"
Buttercup says: "!"
Man Boy says: "Yeah, I'm taking back Christmas from you navi pamby sugar plums with my Yule log."
The 3 Girls punch him off, who lands on the sidewalk.
Man Boy says: "Happy holidays."
Bubbles says: "If we don't get that mug for the Professor, Santa's gonna skip our house for sure."
Blossom says: "Guys, there is no Santa!"
Pug-Faced Paulie and his gang appear.
Pug-Faced Paulie says: "All right, ya broads."
Pug-Faced Paulie says: "Time to give youze da..."
Blossom punches him, Buttercup punches him as well, and, lastly, Bubbles punches him as he hits the ground, making his gang run away barking.
Blossom says: "There it is -- the Clumpkins Outlet!"
The Gnat flies up blocking the store.
Blossom says: "Out of the way, Joey!"
Blossom says: "Almost there!"
Blossom says: "Oh, no!"
Bubbles says: "Oh, no!"
Buttercup says: "Oh, no!"
Steve says: "Sorry, we're closed."
Blossom says: "Closed?!"
Bubbles says: "Closed?!"
Buttercup says: "Closed?!"
Blossom says: "!"
Bubbles says: "!"
Buttercup says: "!"
Blossom says: "But, Steve, we only need one thing!"
Blossom says: "We'll be really fast!"
Steve says: "Well, hey, I have a family, too."
Steve says: "See?"
Steve says: "Best present I ever got."
Blossom says: "Aw!"
Bubbles says: "Aw!"
Buttercup says: "Aw!"
Steve says: "Well, goodnight!"
Blossom says: "Come on, girls."
Blossom says: "Let's go home."
Mojo Jojo says: "Season's beatings, Punypuffs!"
Blossom says: "Not now."
Buttercup says: "We really needed that mug for the Professor."
Bubbles says: "Now he'll never know how much we love him."
All the villains continue laughing, but they start to feel sad.
Buttercup says: "Maybe Santa will help."
Blossom says: "What Santa?"
Mojo Jojo says: "What kind of monster doesn't believe in Santa Claus?"
Blossom says: "Come on."
A picture of a mug breaks into pieces as it falls down. Blossom, Bubbles, and Buttercup are shown inside their house at a table with a tube of glue and a glued together messed up broken mug.
Buttercup says: "Well, maybe now, whenever this mug cuts the inside of the Professor's mouth, he'll think of us."
Blossom says: "Yeah."
Bubbles says: "Yeah."
Sad music plays as the 3 of them put the red ribbon wrapped up mug with the other Christmas presents in their house.
The night sky changes to a sunrise.
Professor says: "It's Christmas!"
Professor says: "It's Christmas, everyone!"
Professor says: "Ooh!"
Professor says: "Ooh!"
Professor says: "Ooh!"
Professor says: "Can I open my present first?"
Professor says: "Please?!"
Professor says: "!"
Buttercup says: "Uh, yeah."
Buttercup says: "Merry Christmas, Professor."
Professor says: "Girls."
Blossom says: "Professor, about your gift..."
Professor says: "I'm gonna try it out now."
Blossom says: "But how did the mug..."
Blossom says: "?"
Bubbles says: "Santa!"
Buttercup says: "Santa!"
Bubbles says: "I knew it!"
Buttercup says: "You know he definitely chucked that present with love."
Blossom says: "I..."
Blossom says: "He does exist."
Bubbles says: "Told ya."
Buttercup says: "Told ya."
Professor says: "Girls!"
Professor says: "10 cups of coffee never tasted so good!"
Blossom says: "Merry Christmas, Professor!"
Bubbles says: "Merry Christmas, Professor!"
Buttercup says: "Merry Christmas, Professor!"
Professor says: "Thanks, girls."
Professor says: "Merry Christmas."
The screen goes to the window where the villains are.
Bianca says: "Aw, look how happy they are."
Morbucks says: "Yes!"
Morbucks says: "And I can't wait to see their faces when the bomb you planted inside of that #1 Dad mug goes off."
Mojo Jojo says: "Wait."
Mojo Jojo says: "Mojo didn't switch the mugs yet."
Mojo Jojo says: "It's right here."
Bianca says: "What?"
Bianca says: "Then who did?"
Real Vision Santa says: "Ho!"
Real Vision Santa says: "Ho!"
Real Vision Santa says: "Ho!"
Real Vision Santa says: "Ho!"
Real Vision Santa says: "Ho!"
Real Vision Santa says: "On to the next town, rocket-powered sled!"
Real Vision Santa says: "Ho!"
Real Vision Santa says: "Ho!"
Real Vision Santa says: "Ho!"
Real Vision Santa says: "Ho!"
Real Vision Santa says: "Ho!"
Episode ends.
