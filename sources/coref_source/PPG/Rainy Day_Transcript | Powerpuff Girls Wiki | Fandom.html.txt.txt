Buttercup says: "Man, I hate rainy days."
Buttercup says: "They're so boring."
Bubbles says: "I have an idea."
Bubbles says: "Let's go outside and jump on the trampoline while twirling golf clubs!"
Blossom says: "No."
Buttercup says: "No."
Buttercup says: "Dude, that's the point of a thunderstorm."
Buttercup says: "You can't go outside, especially not with a bunch of metal."
Bubbles says: "Well, there goes Plan B."
Blossom says: "Come on, guys."
Blossom says: "Rainy days are perfect for playing board games!"
Blossom says: "Like Oligopoly."
Blossom says: "It's all the fun of working in an office from the comfort of your own home."
Buttercup says: "Can I see that?"
Buttercup says: "It says here that board games are called "bored games" because only boring people play them."
Blossom says: "It does not say that!"
Buttercup says: "Wait, wait, wait, wait."
Buttercup says: "It also says Blossom is the most boring person ever."
Buttercup says: "And she also smells like an old shoe?"
Bubbles says: "Those instructions are really specific."
Professor says: "Board games."
Professor says: "That looks like fun."
Buttercup says: "For nerds."
Blossom says: "You want to play, Professor?"
Professor says: "I do!"
Professor says: "But I think I need a nap first."
Professor says: "This rainy weather has got me in the mood for a little R and R."
Professor says: "You girls can entertain yourselves for a bit."
Professor says: "But just as always, no playing in the lab."
Buttercup says: "Dip!"
Buttercup says: "I've got the best idea."
Buttercup says: "Let's go play in the lab."
Bubbles says: "Yes!"
Blossom says: "No!"
Blossom says: "Girls, didn't you just hear what the professor said?"
Blossom says: "We are not supposed to play in the lab."
Buttercup says: "Blossom, I don't mean to call you out here but that is exactly what someone who is boring would say."
Bubbles says: "Now hang on, Buttercup."
Bubbles says: "Blossom raises a good point."
Blossom says: "Thank you, Bubbles."
Bubbles says: "But on the other hand..."
Blossom says: "Come back here!"
Blossom says: "Girls, we should not be here."
Buttercup says: "Check it!"
Buttercup says: "This is weird stuff heaven!"
Blossom says: "Wait!"
Blossom says: "Stop!"
Blossom says: "That's an unstable isotope."
Blossom says: "Bubbles!"
Blossom says: "Don't touch that."
Buttercup says: "What does this do?"
Bubbles says: "What is..."
Bubbles says: "What?"
Buttercup says: "What?"
Blossom says: "Girls, will you just listen for one second?"
Blossom says: "The Time Dasher?"
Bubbles says: "What is it?"
Buttercup says: "Only one way to find out."
Blossom says: "Girls!"
Buttercup says: "Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes."
Bubbles says: "Joop, joop, joop, joop."
Bubbles says: "Beep, boop, beep, boop, beep, boop, beep, boop."
Buttercup says: "I call dibs!"
Bubbles says: "No, me first!"
Blossom says: "No way."
Blossom says: "I am not going to let you past me this time!"
Blossom says: "I know you think I am boring but someday you will appreciate all I go through to keep you two out of trouble."
Buttercup says: "Dude, stop being such a dud and just move!"
Bubbles says: "Blossom!"
Buttercup says: "Blossom!"
Bubbles says: "Blossom!"
Buttercup says: "Blossom!"
Bubbles says: "Blossom, you are okay."
Blossom says: "Blossom smash!"
Buttercup says: "Geez."
Buttercup says: "She turned into a caveblossom."
Buttercup says: "We are going to be in so much trouble if we do not fix this before the professor wakes up."
Professor says: "Girls, I am up!"
Professor says: "I am ready to play board games."
Professor says: "Girls, where are you?"
Bubbles says: "We are right here, professor."
Professor says: "There you are."
Professor says: "Where is Blossom?"
Bubbles says: "Now that you ask, that is an interesting..."
Buttercup says: "She was just..."
Bubbles says: "I do not..."
Bubbles says: "I do not know."
Buttercup says: "Good, you know."
Buttercup says: "She will be..."
Buttercup says: "She will be fine."
Professor says: "Blossom, are you okay?"
Professor says: "You look like you need a nap."
Blossom says: "Blossom no need nap!"
Blossom says: "Blossom smash!"
Buttercup says: "She really just wants to play Oligopoly."
Voices says: "Oligopoly!"
Bubbles says: "My turn!"
Bubbles says: "My turn!"
Bubbles says: "Come on."
Bubbles says: "Mama needs a new pair of Mr Bunny's coding books."
Bubbles says: "Four!"
Bubbles says: "One, two, three..."
Professor says: "Blossom, what is going on?"
Professor says: "It is not like you to play unfair."
Buttercup says: "No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."
Buttercup says: "She is playing fair."
Buttercup says: "That is actually a rule."
Buttercup says: "If you land on that space you have to gnaw on your piece and draw a card instead."
Bubbles says: "Yes."
Bubbles says: "See?"
Bubbles says: "Now I draw my card and..."
Professor says: "Blossom!"
Professor says: "I see what's going on here!"
Professor says: "Your blood sugar is low because you have not had lunch yet."
Professor says: "I knew it."
Professor says: "I will go make you girls some sandwiches."
Buttercup says: "Dude, what do we do?"
Buttercup says: "We can not keep this up much longer."
Bubbles says: "I do not know."
Bubbles says: "Regular Blossom always takes care of this stuff."
Bubbles says: "What would she do?"
Blossom says: "It's the professor's machine."
Blossom says: "He is the only one who knows how to use it."
Blossom says: "We need to tell him, so blah blah blah blah blah."
Blossom says: "I am a know it all and I smell like an old shoe."
Buttercup says: "Classic."
Buttercup says: "Okay, I thought it through and..."
Buttercup says: "Bubbles!"
Buttercup says: "I thought it through and I think regular Blossom would let it slide."
Bubbles says: "She would?"
Buttercup says: "Fine, maybe not."
Blossom says: "Blossom smash!"
Blossom says: "Smash face."
Buttercup says: "Good job, Bubs."
Buttercup says: "Okay, so let us see now."
Buttercup says: "Problem solved."
Buttercup says: "You are not the only genius around here, Blossom."
Blossom says: "But alas, what is genius?"
Blossom says: "is it the sprouting forth of word from the subconscious?"
Blossom says: "Or is it simply an affect developed by the cunning of civilisation?"
Buttercup says: "Man!"
Buttercup says: "She is worse than before!"
Bubbles says: "Yes, this Blossom wants to smash our minds!"
Professor says: "Girls, your sandwiches are ready."
Professor says: "Here you go, girls."
Blossom says: "Hunger of the body is but temporary."
Blossom says: "But the thirst for knowledge is eternal."
Professor says: "You did not think I would notice."
Professor says: "I forgot the drinks."
Professor says: "Silly me."
Professor says: "I will be right back."
Buttercup says: "And bring more sandwiches please!"
Buttercup says: "And take your time!"
Buttercup says: "Okay, I got it all figured out now."
Blossom says: "Onward!"
Blossom says: "To sandwiches!"
Professor says: "You are looking quite heroic."
Bubbles says: "More sandwiches please."
Buttercup says: "More sandwiches please."
Bubbles says: "More please."
Buttercup says: "More please."
Bubbles says: "More please."
Buttercup says: "More please."
Bubbles says: "More."
Buttercup says: "More."
Bubbles says: "More."
Buttercup says: "More."
Bubbles says: "More."
Buttercup says: "More."
Bubbles says: "Can we have more sandwiches please?"
Buttercup says: "Can we have more sandwiches please?"
Professor says: "Looks like I will have to go to the store to get more sandwiches."
Professor says: "Any requests?"
Blossom says: "Blerfergadgyum."
Professor says: "You got it."
Buttercup says: "Man."
Buttercup says: "We got to figure this thing out."
Bubbles says: "Yes, I cannot eat anymore sandwiches."
Buttercup says: "Well, there is only one thing left to do."
Blossom says: "Roboblossom evaluating area."
Blossom says: "Sisters detected."
Buttercup says: "She recognizes us."
Blossom says: "Activating sibling rivalry."
Buttercup says: "What?"
Bubbles says: "Why, Blossom?"
Bubbles says: "What did we ever do to you?"
Blossom says: "I have been programmed with this function because you did not appreciate original Blossom for being a level headed leader."
Bubbles says: "Yes."
Buttercup says: "Yes."
Blossom says: "Also because Buttercup takes too long in the bathroom."
Blossom says: "Seriously, what are you doing in there?"
Buttercup says: "My hair does not look like this on it's own."
Blossom says: "Enough."
Blossom says: "Who is boring now?"
Buttercup says: "Blos, wait!"
Buttercup says: "We are really sorry!"
Bubbles says: "Yes, we should have listened to you about, about leaving the professor's lab alone and stuff!"
Blossom says: "Analysing apology."
Blossom says: "Apology unaccepted."
Buttercup says: "I will never call Blossom boring again after this."
Blossom says: "That is right."
Blossom says: "I am not boring nor do I smell like an old shoe."
Buttercup says: "Well, I mean, are you sure?"
Blossom says: "Annihilate, annihilate, annihilate!"
Blossom says: "Prepare for your doom."
Professor says: "Girls, what are you doing?"
Professor says: "Blossom, is that you?"
Bubbles says: "Professor, look out!"
Buttercup says: "Professor, look out!"
Blossom says: "Father figure detected."
Blossom says: "Must obey."
Blossom says: "Must seek approval."
Professor says: "Blossom, did you get a new haircut?"
Blossom says: "Negative."
Professor says: "Then that means you girls were playing in the lab!"
Bubbles says: "We love you."
Buttercup says: "We love you."
Buttercup says: "I hate cleaning."
Bubbles says: "Yes, this is the worst punishment ever."
Blossom says: "Well, that is what you get for not listening to me!"
Bubbles says: "We are sorry."
Buttercup says: "We are sorry."
Blossom says: "That is okay."
Blossom says: "And just to prove there is no hard feelings, I made you some sandwiches."
Buttercup says: "If I see another sandwich in my life, it will be too soon."
Sandwich says: "Did somebody order a sandwich?"
Buttercup says: "Yes, too soon."
