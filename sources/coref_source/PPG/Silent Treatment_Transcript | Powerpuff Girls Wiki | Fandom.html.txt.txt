Narrator says: "The city of Townsville has a mega-multiplex theater,  the Powerpuff Girls."
Buttercup says: "Aw, have a heart, Professor."
Buttercup says: "Every kid in town is over at the multiplex and you decide to take us to a silent movie theater."
Blossom says: "Yeah, nobody cool ever comes here."
Bubbles says: "And the popcorn is as stale as their dumb old movies."
Professor says: "Silent films are where all movies come from."
Buttercup says: "But, Professor, we like our movies with color and sound."
Blossom says: "Yeah, and car crashes."
Bubbles says: "And explosions."
Girls says: "And in a really cool theater!"
Professor says: "That's all well and good, girls, but you can go to the multiplex any day of the week."
Professor says: "Today is the day you learn all about the history of motion pictures."
Girls says: "Oh, all right."
Professor says: "Oh, boy."
Professor says: "It's a full house."
Professor says: "Oh, this is gonna be so great."
Professor says: "I'm totally excited."
Professor says: "Aren't you?"
Professor says: "Oh, here's a good place to sit."
Professor says: "Not too close and not too far."
Professor says: "Now you just make yourselves comfortable and I'll get some popcorn."
Professor says: "Don't go away now."
Professor says: "And remember - these grand old films are where all movies came from."
Once Professor is gone, old-time piano music can be heard, and the movie starts. The girls roll their eyes. The camera switches to the movie screen with a title card saying "Joseph M. Skunk presents Max Von Nitrate in For Once, He Is Speechless; Directed by Cecil B. Centipede".
Buttercup says: ""Remember, girls, it's where all movies came from."
Blossom says: "No, they didn't."
Blossom says: "They came from cans!"
The girls laugh.
Blossom says: "What's this?"
Buttercup says: "Looks like Mitch Mitchellson's house."
Bubbles says: "Only cleaner."
A black shoe kicks the door open.
Blossom says: "Uh-oh."
Buttercup says: "Somebody forgot to knock."
Buttercup says: "Whoa, who's that?"
Blossom says: "The bad guy."
Bubbles says: "How can you tell?"
Blossom says: "He's the one with the flycatcher for a moustache."
The girls laugh again.
Blossom says: "And the girl is a damsel in distress."
Bubbles says: "Shh, he's speaking."
Buttercup says: ""At last, I have you in my power?"
Buttercup says: "" Oh, man, what a cornball."
Blossom says: "This is too much."
Buttercup says: "Yeah, look at him."
Buttercup says: "Where does he get his moustache wax from, his ears?"
The girls laugh again.
Buttercup says: "Oh, no, now he's gonna go into a big spiel."
Buttercup says: ""..."
Buttercup says: "Nitrate!"
Buttercup says: "I see all and control all!"
Buttercup says: "" Okay, I'm done."
Bubbles says: "Now, what's he gonna do?"
Blossom says: "Maybe he's leaving."
Buttercup says: "No such luck."
Blossom says: "Uh-oh."
Buttercup says: "He's locking the door!"
Buttercup says: "Oh my gosh!"
Bubbles says: "Yikes!"
Blossom says: "I don't believe it!"
Buttercup says: "He's swallowing the key whole."
Bubbles says: ""Key, whole."
Bubbles says: "" Get it."
Max says: "Burp!"
Buttercup says: "Gross!"
Buttercup says: "Hey, now he's being creepy."
Blossom says: "A snake in the grass."
Blossom says: "Oh, look, she gets the artie shot."
Bubbles says: "I know I don't like this movie!"
Buttercup says: "Yeah, this picture stinks."
Blossom says: "I agree."
The girls blow raspberries and laugh their hardest.
Buttercup says: "Take that, furry lip!"
Blossom says: "Ha ha!"
Bubbles says: "Yeah!"
Max says: "You kids are starting to get on my nerves!"
Max says: "Let's see if you find this funny!!"
Max removes the hair from the woman, revealing that it's a wig, and the character looks familiar.
Blossom says: ""Girls!"
Blossom says: "Save me!!"
The shot switches back to the victim, and the girls realize who it is.
Girls says: "It's the Professor!"
Blossom says: "What do you want with the Professor anyway, Mr."
Blossom says: "Moustache?"
Max says: "I want his VOICE!"
Girls says: "His voice?!"
Girls says: "!"
Max says: "A simple operation really..."
Max says: "I put his voice into my throat!"
Girls says: "Operation?!"
Girls says: "!"
Buttercup says: "This guy's totally nuts."
Buttercup says: "What do we do?"
Bubbles says: "We have to get in there and stop him."
Girls says: "He's in there!"
Buttercup says: "Give us back the Professor!"
Blossom says: "We're in the silent movie now..."
Blossom says: "we can only talk in titles!"
Max says: "See ya, Powerless Girls!"
Blossom says: "He's gonna steal the Professor's voice!"
Buttercup says: "We gotta stop him!"
Bubbles says: "We gotta stop him!"
Blossom says: "He's stolen our powers too!"
Buttercup says: "Then, we'll just have to save the Professor without them!"
Max says: "A quick trip across the ocean and your voice will be mine!"
Max says: "No, no, not that!!"
Blossom says: "Hey, we got our color back."
Buttercup says: "And our voices, too."
Bubbles says: "He's headed for the projector booth."
Blossom says: "Let's go!"
Blossom says: "All right, Max."
Blossom says: "Give it up."
Blossom says: "We know you're here."
Blossom says: "The projectionist and the silent movie villain are the same guy."
Blossom says: "Cheer up, Max."
Blossom says: "We'll get you a new voice."
Buttercup says: "Sure."
Buttercup says: "They do it all with computers."
Max says: "You'd do all that for me?"
Girls says: "Sure!"
Max says: "I said that will be all, Jeeves."
Professor says: "Stop that!"
Max says: "Thank you, Powerpuff Girls."
Professor says: "Help me, girls, please!"
A final title card reads "...And so once again the day is saved, thanks to the Powerpuff Girls!".
The End!
Weâ€™ll see you again soon!
