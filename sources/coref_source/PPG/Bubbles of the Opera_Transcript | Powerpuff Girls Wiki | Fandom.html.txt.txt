(Opening scene says: "Cut to Blossom wearing a presidential dress."
(Opening scene says: "She gets her suitcase out and opens it with her bows on it."
(Opening scene says: "She picks up two bows."
(Opening scene says: ")"
Blossom says: "Professor, which says "Future Elected Official"?"
Blossom says: "Fire truck red, or candy apple red?"
Professor Utonium says: "Uh, I don't know, Blossom."
Professor Utonium says: "They're both lovely."
Buttercup says: "Ow!"
Buttercup says: "Ow!"
Professor Utonium says: "Hold still, Buttercup."
Buttercup says: "This sweater is so itchy!"
Professor Utonium says: "Uh, please."
Professor Utonium says: "I'd like to have this cowlick under control."
Buttercup says: "Ow!"
Professor Utonium says: "For at least one school picture day."
Buttercup says: "Ow!"
Blossom says: "I think I'll go with rocket red."
Blossom says: "For perseverance in the face of adversity!"
Buttercup says: "Ow!"
Buttercup says: "Stop!"
Buttercup says: "What's the point?!"
Buttercup says: "!"
Buttercup says: "School photos are the worst!"
Buttercup says: "No one ever looks good in them."
Blossom says: "Yeah."
Blossom says: "No one, but you-know-who."
Bubbles says: "Oh, my!"
Bubbles says: "Is it school picture day?"
Bubbles says: "When he photographs me, I feel like Miguel really captures the essence of my face."
Buttercup says: "Uh-huh."
Photographer says: "Next!"
Bubbles says: "Whee!"
Bubbles says: "You're not Miguel!"
Lunch Lady says: "Nope."
Lunch Lady says: "I'm his replacement."
Lunch Lady says: "I just got promoted from the cafeteria."
[Note says: "She's referred to as the lunch lady due to her having worked in the cafeteria."
Bubbles says: "B-b-b-but..."
Lunch Lady says: "Ah, relax, kid."
Lunch Lady says: "Any dumb-dumb can work a camera these days."
Lunch Lady says: "Now, tilt your head this way, reach your shoulder to the sky, and say "Give me the sauce"!"
Bubbles says: "Give me the wha..."
Bubbles says: "?"
One week later...
At the school, Bubbles screams from o.s. She looks at her picture as Buttercup and Blossom come to see it.
Buttercup says: "What?"
Buttercup says: "You took a bad school photo?"
Bubbles says: "Give it back!"
Buttercup says: "And not just bad, probably the worst school PHOTO EVER!!!"
Buttercup says: "Don't cry, dude it's funny."
Bubbles says: "I don't want it to be funny!"
Bubbles says: "I want it to be cute!"
Blossom says: "Bubbles, it's okay."
Buttercup says: "Yeah, nobody bats 1,000."
Buttercup says: "I mean, this first year, mine actually turned out okay."
Bubbles says: "I've never felt so ugly before..."
Blossom says: "Bubbles, it's not a big deal."
Blossom says: "You could just do retakes."
Lunch Lady says: "No retakes this year, kiddos!"
Lunch Lady says: "I just got fired!"
Lunch Lady says: "The world works in mysterious ways!"
Bubbles says: "I'm gonna be ugly forever!!!!"
Blossom says: "You're not ugly, Bubbles."
Blossom says: "Come on, you just need a little pick-me-up."
Cut to the town square after school where Blossom and Buttercup take Bubbles to the hair salon. Once there, Bubbles is in the salon chair raised by a stylist.
Blossom says: "We'd like a fresh new look for our sister here."
Barber says: "Great, and how much are you girls looking to spend today?"
Blossom says: "Oh."
Blossom says: "Um..."
Blossom says: "well..."
Buttercup says: "I have a free burger coupon you can have."
Barber Man says: "Ooh, I'll go get our apprentice stylist."
Lunch Lady says: "Hello!"
Buttercup says: "You again?!"
Buttercup says: "!"
Blossom says: "How did you get this job?"
Lunch Lady says: "Oh, come on."
Lunch Lady says: "Any dumb-dumb with a pair of scissors can cut hair."
At the bathroom, Bubbles hair is now short. Blossom thinks for a moment as Buttercup finds something.
Blossom says: "I can fix this..."
Blossom says: ".."
Blossom says: "I can..."
Blossom says: "Wait."
Blossom says: "Didn't the stuff get recalled?"
Blossom says: "Something about, horrible allergic reactions?"
Buttercup says: "Eh, I'm sure it's fine!"
Buttercup says: "PROFESSOR!!!"
Cut to Professor Utonium wiping the swell on Bubbles' cheek.
Professor Utonium says: "This will get the swelling under control."
Professor Utonium says: "There now."
Bubbles says: "Professor, am I not "The Cute One" anymore?"
Professor Utonium says: ""The Cute One"?"
Bubbles says: "Yeah, you know."
Bubbles says: "Blossom is The Smart One, Buttercup is The Cool One..."
Bubbles says: "If I'm not The Cute One, what am I?"
Professor Utonium says: "Oh Bubbles, being cute is such a small part of the amazing person you are."
Professor Utonium says: "But between you and me, you're the cutest one in the whole wide world."
Bubbles says: "You mean it?"
The Professor nods in agreement.
Bubbles says: "Yeah!"
Bubbles says: "You're right!"
Bubbles says: "I'm not going to let this get me down."
Bubbles hits the ceiling fan by accident and ricochets across the room.
Bubbles says: "Whoaaaaa!"
The next scene we see Bubbles and the Professor left the dentist's office.
Professor Utonium says: "Whoo!"
Professor Utonium says: "Good thing those were just baby teeth huh?"
Blossom and Buttercup fly over to Bubbles and the Professor. They are holding some ice cream cones.
Blossom says: "Bubbles!"
Buttercup says: "We got you some ice cream!"
Blossom says: "We didn't know what flavor you'd want."
Buttercup says: "So we got you all of them!"
Bubbles says: "Aw thanks, guys!"
Bubbles says: "I'm actually feeling a lot better!"
Bubbles says: "What?"
Bubbles says: "Is it bad?"
Blossom says: "N-No!"
Buttercup says: "YES!"
Buttercup says: "Dude yes it is!"
Blossom says: "Buttercup!!"
Buttercup says: "I can't lie!"
A bus comes by, the children on the bus scream in fear.
Child #1 says: "What is that thing!"
Child #1 says: "?!"
Child #1 says: "!"
Child #2 says: "It's hideous!"
A bunch of negative comments continues to be said as the bus passes. Bubbles starts to tear up.
Bubbles says: "I'm..."
Bubbles says: "I'M A MONSTER!!!"
Blossom says: "What!"
Blossom says: "?"
Blossom says: "No!"
Bubbles says: "It's true!"
Bubbles says: "I'm a monster!"
Bubbles says: "An ugly, hideous monster!!"
Buttercup says: "Dude this is all in your head."
Blossom says: "Bubbles, you're being kind of crazy."
Bubbles says: "Oh!"
Bubbles says: "So now you think I'm ugly and crazy!"
Bubbles says: "I thought I've just been the cute one to you."
Bubbles says: "And now I'm not cute, you think I'm worthless, right?!"
Bubbles says: "!"
Professor Utonium says: "Heh alright girls, I think it's time we go home now."
Bubbles says: "Home?"
Bubbles says: "Home?!"
Bubbles says: "!"
Bubbles says: "I'm never going home!"
Bubbles says: "Never!"
Bubbles says: "Never!"
Buttercup says: "So..."
Buttercup says: "Can we eat her ice cream?"
Cut to the next scene, it is currently storming and we hear someone playing a piano. It's shown to be Bubbles playing it. She is wearing a dark red cape and half a bunny mask that appears to be covering the rash on the left side of her face.
Bubbles says: "There's only one place I can go now."
She then knocks on a door to somebody's home. It was Mojo Jojo's as he answers the door wearing a girly chef's hat and apron, whisking cookie dough in a bowl. He was caught off guard when he saw that it was Bubbles who knocked on his door.
Mojo says: "Well, this is awkward."
Cut to the next scene where Mojo and Bubbles sit at a table. Mojo is pouring Bubbles a cup of tea with his kitty tea set.
Mojo says: "Come now."
Mojo says: "Tell Mojo."
Mojo says: "What's on your mind?"
Bubbles says: "Well..."
Bubbles says: "I wanna reek vengeance on those who have forsaken me."
Bubbles says: "So, I came to the only person who knows what it's like to be rejected for being hideous."
Mojo gasps in offense for being considered hideous. Mojo gets up.
Mojo says: "Mojo's not hideous!"
Mojo says: "He's at least a solid..."
Mojo says: "eight!"
Bubbles says: "Okay the point is we can team up."
Bubbles says: "I can be your evil acolyte."
Mojo says: "Nope."
Mojo says: "Sorry, Mojo operates solo!"
Mojo says: "He has no room for sidekicks."
Bubbles says: "Um..."
Bubbles says: "you have bunk beds."
We see a pair of bunk beds behind Mojo.
Mojo says: "Curse that aggressive salesman!"
Bubbles says: "So what do you say?"
Mojo says: "Hmm."
Mojo says: "Very well."
Mojo says: "We shall wreak havoc on this forsaken Townsville."
Mojo says: "Oh, uh--nothing."
Cut to the next scene, we see the Townsville Zoo. Bubbles makes animal noises in order for them to go on a rampage.
Mojo says: "Your ability to talk to animals and my evil genius, we will..."
Mojo says: "we will do many bad things."
Bubbles says: "Come my cutesy critters!"
Bubbles says: "Go forth!"
Bubbles says: "And destroy!"
Bubbles says: "DESTROY!"
A rhino and a monkey destroy a hair salon and then two giraffes destroy a photography studio. Bubbles then does an evil laugh. Blossom and Buttercup then rush to the scene.
Blossom says: "Bubbles?"
Blossom says: "What are you doing?"
Bubbles says: "There is no more Bubbles."
Bubbles says: "I have shed that name."
Bubbles says: "From henceforth, there is only..."
Bubbles says: "Dark Bubbles!"
Buttercup says: "Oh, Dark Bubbles."
Buttercup says: "Wow, you really changed it up there."
[Note says: "Bubbles will be known as Dark Bubbles unless it's said otherwise."
Dark Bubbles says: "SILENCE!"
Dark Bubbles says: "You cannot stop me and my hideous henchman."
Mojo says: "Oh come on!"
Blossom says: "Alright Bubbles."
(Goof says: "Blossom's trail is blue instead of pink."
(Goof says: "The two then grab her by the arms."
(Goof says: ")"
Blossom says: "Let's get you home."
Dark Bubbles says: "Let go of me!"
Mojo says: "Good job Dark Bubbles!"
Mojo says: "Now, destroy your sisters!"
Dark Bubbles lifts up a hippo over Blossom and Buttercup, about to crush them with its weight.
Blossom says: "Bubbles!"
Blossom says: "What are you doing?"
Blossom says: "This isn't you!"
Dark Bubbles says: "This is me!"
Dark Bubbles says: "You've made me this."
Dark Bubbles says: "A monster!"
Buttercup says: "Dude no!"
Buttercup says: "You're the best sister in the world!"
Buttercup says: "Remember when I went out on my skateboard you took care of me?"
Blossom says: "Or when I had spinach in my teeth, and everyone made fun of me, so you put spinach in your teeth too?"
Dark Bubbles starts tearing up.
Mojo says: "No!"
Mojo says: "No!"
Mojo says: "Don't listen to them!"
Mojo says: "Drop the hippo!"
Mojo says: "Now!"
Blossom says: "Bubbles, you're a good person."
Buttercup says: "You're like, the most caring person in the world Bubbs."
Dark Bubbles continuously tears up.
Mojo says: "Hey hey!"
Mojo says: "Dark Bubbles!"
Mojo says: "Don't listen to them!"
Mojo says: "This is your destiny!"
Blossom says: "No it's not!"
Mojo says: "Yes that is!"
Mojo says: "You're evil now!"
Dark Bubbles starts looking back and forth at her sisters and Mojo.
Blossom says: "No you're not!"
Mojo says: "Yes you are!"
Buttercup says: "Don't!"
Blossom says: "No!"
Mojo says: "Yes!"
Mojo says: "Do it!"
Mojo says: "Do it!"
Dark Bubbles has had enough and breaks up the argument.
Dark Bubbles says: "Silence!"
Dark Bubbles says: "I have made my choice."
[Note says: "She's referred to as Bubbles now as she is no longer evil."
Bubbles says: "My beasties!"
Bubbles says: "You are released!"
All the animals quit destroying things by Bubbles' command. Blossom and Buttercup are freed from the snakes. Bubbles then flies up to Mojo.
Bubbles says: "And you."
Bubbles says: "You're going to pay for this."
Mojo says: "Hey."
Mojo says: "It was your idea!"
Bubbles says: "Oh, yeah."
Bubbles says: "And that's why I'm gonna let you go this one time cuz I got a good team here."
Bubbles says: "And when we get mad, we aren't very cute."
Mojo says: "Okay, Mojo is on his way."
Mojo says: "Come on, go."
Bubbles takes her hoodie off.
Bubbles says: "I'm sorry guys."
Bubbles says: "I had no idea I'd let my identity become so defined by being cute."
Blossom says: "Yeah talk about limiting yourself."
Buttercup says: "Under the surface you're like, terrifying."
Buttercup says: "So much better than being cute."
Lunch Lady says: "I think we all learned a lot today."
Buttercup says: "Not you again!"
Lunch Lady says: "You know it!"
Lunch Lady says: "I'm back in the photo game after that salon got a restraining order against me."
Lunch Lady says: "Hey can I get a shot for the Townsville Daily?"
Bubbles says: "Yes!"
Bubbles says: "Yes you can."
Lunch Lady says: "Okay everyone say break me off a slice of that funk pie!"
The next day. We see the photograph pinned on the refrigerator.
Buttercup says: "You really want to hang that one up?"
Bubbles says: "Yeah!"
Bubbles says: "I look so happy."
Bubbles says: "Plus, I'm with my favorite people in the whole wide world."
Blossom says: "Wow, you really learned a lot from this Bubbles."
Bubbles says: "Yep!"
Bubbles says: "Most importantly that I'll never be as ugly as Mojo."
Cut to Mojo sitting at his table holding his kitty tea cup in the slumps.
Mojo says: "Unbelievable."
