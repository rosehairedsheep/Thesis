* Mayor says: "The city of Townsville… …is entirely mine!"
* Mayor says: "I love this job!"
His perspective of his office, approaching his desk chair, which has a set of steps next to it.
* Mayor says: "There’s just so much to love about being the Mayor!"
* Mayor says: "Meeting new people, visiting exotic places, soaring to new heights."
* Mayor says: "And I love my office!"
Camera rotates to point across the desk on the end of this line. On it are a phone, a picture of the Mayor’s wife, an intercom speaker, and some papers with a drawing on the top sheet. The hotline is on a nearby stand.
* Mayor says: "I love my phone—"
* Mayor says: "Uh, Ms."
* Mayor says: "Bellum…what am I supposed to do?"
Ms. Bellum says: "Good morning, Mayor."
Ms. Bellum says: "Well, you can start by signing some very important documents on your desk."
Camera turns down slightly to show the papers; the drawing is of the Mayor as a bodybuilder, with the words “I’m Strong!” underneath. He continues to work on it as he speaks.
* Mayor says: "Important documents?"
* Mayor says: "Where would those be?"
* Mayor says: "Important documents…  Oh!"
* Mayor says: "“Im-por-tant…nnnnnew…lllllaw."
* Mayor says: "” Hmmm!"
* Mayor says: "Wonder what this is all about."
* Mayor says: "Well, it must be important."
* Mayor says: "I’ll sign it."
He taps on the desk for a long moment, then activates the intercom again.
* Mayor says: "Hi, Ms."
* Mayor says: ", uh, Bellum, ah—"
Ms. Bellum says: "M…A…Y…O…R."
* Mayor says: "Oh, uh, yes."
* Mayor says: "Thank you, Ms."
* Mayor says: "Bellum."
* Mayor says: "Oh, my!"
Pan quickly over to the office window, smashed.
* Mayor says: "What’s all that glass doing on the floor?"
Mojo Jojo pops into view at point-blank range. The Mayor cries out in surprise as he leaps high into the air and swings a club toward the camera. The screen explodes into stars briefly; when these clear, we see Mojo again, holding the club and grinning evilly. The image goes into and out of focus as the Mayor speaks, and the camera slowly tilts toward the floor.
He trails off, and the camera stops at Mojo’s feet. Fade to black as the Mayor presumably passes out and falls unconscious. Several seconds pass before he speaks again, and it's still dark.
*Mayor says: "Oh, my head!"
*Mayor says: "Oh!"
*Mayor says: "Where am I?"
*Mayor says: "Why can’t I see?"
*Mayor says: "…Wait!"
*Mayor says: "And why can’t I move my arms and legs?"
*Mojo says: "Oh, shut up already!"
*Mayor says: "Who’s that?"
*Mayor says: "Is that you, Mommy?"
*Mojo says: "No, dummy!"
*Mojo says: "It’s me, the evil Mojo Jojo!"
*Mojo says: "I blindfolded and tied you up in order to keep the whereabouts of my secret lair a secret!"
*Mayor says: "Oh!"
*Mayor says: "You mean the observatory on the top of the volcano in the middle of Townsville Central Park?"
*Mojo says: "Ooh, shut up, I say!"
*Mojo says: "I say “shut up” because I am going to become powerful."
*Mojo says: "But before I can become powerful, I must be taken seriously."
*Mojo says: "And the only way to be taken seriously is to rule the city of Townsville as the Mayor!"
*Mojo says: "But in order for me to become Mayor, you cannot be Mayor, and that is why I had to strip you of your—"
He is cut off by a crash and the sound of the girls’ arrival.
*Blossom says: "Not—"
*Buttercup says: "—"
*Buttercup says: "so fast—"
*Bubbles says: "—"
*Bubbles says: "Mojo Jojo!"
*Mojo says: "Powerpuff Girls!"
*Mojo says: "Ooh, take this!"
A fight breaks out; he and the Girls trade blows for a while.
*Blossom says: "Ow!"
*Blossom says: "That’s it, Mojo."
*Blossom says: "Now you’re gonna get it!"
We hear him take several blows with little retaliation and collapse groaning to the floor. Seems the Girls gave him a good thrashing once Blossom was heard warning him he was in trouble after striking her and setting off her berserk button.
*Blossom says: "Let’s get the Mayor!"
*Blossom says: "Are you okay, Mayor?"
*Mayor says: "What’s so funny?"
After a few seconds of flying and giggling, we hear them land. The black screen wipes to an extreme close-up of Blossom’s eyes—the Mayor’s perspective again. He screams in surprise.
* Mayor says: "Oh!"
* Mayor says: "Hi, Blossom."
* Mayor says: "Hey, where am I?"
She backs up from the camera, holding a piece of cloth—the blindfold—and the view from the desk is re-established. The other Girls are now on the other side of it.
Blossom says: "Back in your office, safe and sound."
* Mayor says: "A-OK, I think."
* Mayor says: "Why, that was some fight I heard."
* Mayor says: "Thank you for saving my life—"
* Mayor says: "although what was so gosh darn funny?"
* Mayor says: "Why were you all laughing?"
Blossom says: "Well…you don’t want to hear it."
Blossom says: "It…it’s such a long story."
Bubbles says: "Yeah, long story."
Buttercup says: "Yeah, long story."
* Mayor says: "I got time."
Blossom says: "Well, you see, it goes like this."
Bubbles says: "We were all at school."
A crayon drawing of the school building appears, complete with a happy sun and a few clouds. Next we see Bubbles, holding a picture of a flower. An arrow with her name points to her.
* Bubbles says: "And I was drawing a pretty picture of a red daisy."
The words “red flower” appear by the picture. As she continues, pull back to show Blossom—labeled with her name—making a disparaging comment; Bubbles’ expression saddens.
* Bubbles says: "But then Blossom came along and said that the red daisy was bi…bi-o-ge…netical…biogenetically impossible!"
The petals fall off the picture, and Bubbles’ label changes to “Sad Bubbles.” A moment later, the flower sprouts yellow petals and gets a new label and she brightens again. She holds up both pictures, labeled with their respective colors.
* Bubbles says: "So then I made it a yellow one, but I really liked the red one."
* Bubbles says: "Maybe I should have just made two flowers, one red and one—"
* Buttercup says: "Bubbles!"
Back to the office.
Buttercup says: "The Mayor doesn’t want to hear about your stupid hero stories."
Buttercup says: "He just wants to know the bare facts."
Buttercup says: "Who cares about a dumb old flower anyway?"
Buttercup says: "Mayor, I’ll tell you what really happened."
Buttercup says: "See—"
Cut to her sitting on the floor in the classroom, reading a book. The picture is rendered entirely in pink and red tones.
* Blossom says: "…brushing up on my conversational Chinese, when all of a sudden, my hotline phone rang."
* Blossom says: "I knew there was trouble, and I had to act fast."
* Blossom says: "I rushed to the phone—"
Back to the office.
Buttercup says: "Why is everything always about you?"
Buttercup says: "We were there too."
Bubbles says: "Yeah!"
Bubbles says: "And I was drawing a very important picture."
Bubbles says: "Although now I can’t remember if it was a yellow flower or a pink flower—"
Bubbles says: "hey, Blossom, do you remember what color it—"
(Pink shot says: "Blossom talking into the hotline."
(Pink shot says: ")"
* Blossom says: "…I answered the phone—"
* Blossom says: "—"
* Blossom says: "oh, and Buttercup and Bubbles were there too, I guess."

* Blossom says: "It was Ms."

* Blossom says: "She informed me that you’d been kidnapped!"
Back to the office.
Bubbles says: "Hey, you mean Mayor-napped, don’t you?"
Bubbles says: "He’s not a little kid, you know."
Buttercup says: "Yeah, he’s no spring chicken."
Bubbles says: "Yeah, he’s no chicken."
Blossom says: "Mr."
Blossom says: "Mayor, you had written an elaborate note telling Ms."
Blossom says: "Bellum that you’d gone home to write your election speech."
* Mayor says: "I did?"
* Mayor says: "How smart of me!"
Blossom says: "That’s not what I mean!"
Blossom says: "See, you didn’t actually write the note."
* Mayor says: "But you just said I wrote the note!"
Blossom says: "Ms."
Blossom says: "Bellum said that you couldn’t have possibly written the note because she writes all of your speeches."
* Mayor says: "Me and Bellum wrote the note?"
Blossom says: "NOOOO Neither you nor Ms."
* Mayor says: "Then who wrote the note?"
* Mayor says: "I’m sorry, Blossom, but this is all terribly confusing."
Blossom says: "I knew that there was only one evil menacing character cunning enough to do this."
Bubbles says: "Mojo Jojo!"
* Mayor says: "Mojo Jojo?"
Girls says: "Yes!"
Girls says: "Yes!"
* Mayor says: "Mojo Jojo wrote my speech?"
* Mayor says: "I’ll have to thank him."
Buttercup says: "Ahh!"
Buttercup says: "Mojo wrote the note!"
Cut to the exterior of the observatory, rendered in black, white, and yellow-green.
* Buttercup says: "We got to the observatory—"
* Buttercup says: "—"
* Buttercup says: "rescued you—"
Back to the office.
Buttercup says: "—"
Buttercup says: "and here we are!"
Buttercup says: "Can we go home now?"
Blossom says: "Buttercup!"
Blossom says: "There’s more to the story than that!"
* Mayor says: "Why were you laughing so much?"
* Mayor says: "My life was at stake!"
* Mayor says: "I don’t see what was so funny."
Blossom says: "Well, I’m trying to get to that, Mayor—"
Blossom says: "—"
Blossom says: "if Buttercup would just butt out and let me tell the story!"
(Pink shot says: "the girls in flight, with Blossom in the lead."

* Blossom says: "We quickly forged out on our mission to defeat Mojo Jojo, in a typical V-pattern formation."
(Crayon drawing says: "the girls in flight."
(Crayon drawing says: ")"
* Bubbles says: "Yeah."
* Bubbles says: "We were flying to Mojo Jojo’s house."
* Bubbles says: "I like flying."
* Bubbles says: "Oh, and then there were these really pretty clouds."
* Bubbles says: "And there was one that was shaped like a heart, and there was this one that looked like a pretty pony, and there was one that looked like a cloud—"
We see each shape of cloud as she mentions it. Back to the office.
A blueprint of Mojo’s lair appears.
* Blossom says: "I devised a tactical plan based on past scenarios we have encountered."
* Blossom says: "Abiding to my Powerpuff Girls plan book—"
* Blossom says: "—"
* Blossom says: "we surrounded the perimeter of the evil Mojo Jojo compound, as outlined in section Ten-A."
Back to the office.
Buttercup says: "What are you talking about?!"
Buttercup says: "!"

* Bubbles says: "Yeah!"
* Bubbles says: "Mojo did a very silly thing, he did—"
* Bubbles says: "—"
* Bubbles says: "blowing a hole in his house."
Mojo appears, with the label “Mad Monkey” by him. He is red-faced and literally boiling over.
* Bubbles says: "Boy, was he mad."
* Bubbles says: "There was steam coming out of his ears."
The picture changes to show him crying and labeled “Sad Monkey.”.
* Bubbles says: "But I knew that deep down inside he was a sad, poor little monkey."
Back to the office.
Blossom says: "Stop it, stop it, STOP IT!"
Blossom says: "You’re not making any sense!"
Blossom says: "The Mayor isn’t following your stories at all!"
Buttercup says: "Well, if you would butt out, maybe he would!"
Bubbles says: "Yeah!"
Bubbles says: "Butt out!"
Bubbles says: "Let me tell the story."
Bubbles says: "I tell it the bestest."
Bubbles says: "Besides, I remember everything like it happened yesterday."
Blossom says: "IT HAPPENED TODAY!"
Blossom says: "See?"
Blossom says: "This is what I mean!"
Buttercup says: "Oh, shut up!"
Bubbles says: "You don’t even know how to tell a good bedtime story!"
* Mayor says: "Girls!"
* Mayor says: "Girls!"

* Bubbles says: "Bigger than his laser machine, even."
As she continues, pull back to show a larger gun, a cannon, and the robot.

Girls says: "Bye!"
* Mayor says: "Wait!"
* Mayor says: "Why were you laughing?"
Pull back to show him looking out the window after them. He is wearing nothing but his hat and monocle. That means that Mojo stripped him of his clothes, but was unable to say that earlier before the Girls interrupted him.
Mayor says: "Why were you girls laughing?"
Narrator says: "Oh, Mayor, looks like Mojo stripped you of even more than your power."
The standard end shot comes up.
Narrator says: "But the girls couldn’t bear  to tell you the naked truth."
