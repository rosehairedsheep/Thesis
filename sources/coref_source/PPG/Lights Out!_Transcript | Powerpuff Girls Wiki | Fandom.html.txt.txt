Bliss says: "Straight from outer space, this little device, is called a Gleep-Flurp-Zerbom-3000."
Bliss says: "But we at the Universal Protection Bureau, just call it a Buggly."
Crowd says: "Oh!"
Crowd says: "Yah!"
Crowd says: "Much easier to pronounce!"
Bliss says: "It's super simple to use!"
Buttercup says: "That Buggly is really something Wheelz could roll with."
Blossom says: "Whoa, getting pizza whenever I want will really free up space in my brain to overanalyze every interaction I have!"
Jared says: "Oh, hi, Blossom."
Blossom says: "Hiya, Jared!"
Blossom's Thoughts says: ""Hiya, Jared?"
Blossom's Thoughts says: "" What was that?"
Blossom's Thoughts says: "Just say "Hi" like a normal person!"

At night, all 3 Girls, Blossom, Buttercup and Bliss laugh wearing their Bugglies, except Bubbles holding her Buggly in her hand with a screwdriver in her other hand.
Blossom says: "Bliss, these Bugglies are great."
Bliss says: "Thanks."
Bliss says: "We use them a ton at the Universal Protection Bureau."
Blossom says: "I can see why."
Blossom says: "The possibilities are endless."
Blossom says: "Buggly, get me a Penguin Pete's soy wheat grass ice cream smoothie with extra chai!"
Bubbles says: "But, Blossom, why don't we just go to Penguin Pete's?"
Bubbles says: "It's right here."
Blossom says: "Yeah, but it's so much easier with the Buggly."
Blossom's Thoughts says: "Did I say that sentence weird?"
Buttercup says: "Buggly, get me a Wheelz hat."
Buttercup says: "Yes!"
Bubbles is looking at her Buggly using the screwdriver.
Bliss says: "Hey, Bubbles, why aren't you wearing yours?"
Bubbles says: "Oh."
Bubbles says: "I'm just interested in how the Buggly works."
Bubbles says: "It's particle movement abilities are really something else."
Buttercup says: "Well, all I know it's given me everything I've ever wanted and more."
Buttercup says: "Buggly, get me a pie."

Bubbles says: "Someone must have set off an electromagnetic pulse to knock out all the power."
Blossom says: "Who would do such a thing?"
Blossom says: "Bliss!"
Bubbles says: "Bliss!"
Buttercup says: "Bliss!"
Blossom says: "Huh?"
Bubbles says: "Huh?"
Buttercup says: "Huh?"
Bliss appears on all the TVs especially in the windows which has TVs and laughs maniacally before transforming into Silico who, after all, started all of this.
Silico says: "Hello, girls."
Blossom says: "Silico!"
Bubbles says: "Silico!"
Buttercup says: "Silico!"
Buttercup says: "What did you do with Bliss, ya geek?"
Silico says: "Oh, nothing."
Silico says: "Nothing at all."
Silico says: "I knew you would trust your big sister."
Silico says: "So, I took her form to give everyone in Townsville my latest weapon."
Bubbles says: "Weapon?"
Silico says: "That's right."
Silico says: "The Gleep-Flurp-Zerbom-3000."
Silico says: "!"
Silico says: "The Buggly."
The Girls says: "Oh."
The Girls says: "yeah, right."
The Girls says: "The Buggly."
Bubbles says: "I knew something with such a cute name had to have a catch!"
Buttercup says: "Ehh, not to worry."
Buttercup says: "Leave it to Wheelz."
Buttercup says: "Buggly, smash Silico."
Silico says: "You'll find out that yours don't work anymore."
Silico says: "Everyone else, on the other hand, theirs work quite well."
Silico says: "Thanks to the Buggly, everyone in Townsville has now been programmed to destroy you."
Brown-Skinned Old Guy With Glasses says: "What did the..."
Brown-Skinned Old Guy With Glasses says: "?"
Schedulebot says: "Time for destruction."
Auto-Scheduling Kitty Bot says: "Meow."
Bubbles says: "Run!"
Buttercup says: "Wheelz don't like this."
Bubbles says: "Oh."
Bubbles says: "I wish the Professor was here so he could help us."
The scene switches to the Professor who is still on the rollercoaster going up.
The Professor says: "Oh, this is gonna be great!"
The Professor says: "Ooh!"
The scene switches back to the 3 Girls.
Blossom says: "We're gonna have to do it without him."
Blossom says: "Let's start searching."
Ms. Keane says: "Oh, girls!"
Ms. Keane says: "Time to teach you a lesson."
Bubbles says: "That was close!"
The Mayor says: "Buggly, pickle blaster!"
Blossom says: "This is horrible!"
Blossom says: "We can't find Silico if we keep getting shot out of the sky!"
Buttercup says: "And the Mayor burned my Wheelz hat off!"
Buttercup says: "How is anybody gonna remember what to call me know?"
Blossom says: "Will you stop trying to make people call you Wheelz?!"
Blossom says: "!"
Buttercup says: "It's Wheel-zuh!"
Buttercup says: "With a Z!"
Blossom and Buttercup hit each other with their eyes closed and heads turned away.
Bubbles says: "Stop it!"
Bubbles says: "Hey!"
Bubbles says: "Guys, stop it!"
Bliss says: "Hey, guys!"
Bliss says: "Surprise!"
Bubbles says: "It's Silico!"
Blossom says: "Get him!"
Bliss says: "What?"
Bliss says: "Ah!"
Bliss says: "What are you guys doing?"
Bliss says: "I'm not Silico."
Blossom says: "Yes, you are!"
Buttercup says: "You can't fool Wheelz twice!"
Buttercup says: "I'm always spinning."
Bubbles says: "If you're Bliss, prove it!"
Blossom says: "Yeah!"
Buttercup says: "Yeah!"
Buttercup says: "Wheelz!"
Bliss says: "Um, I'm currently suspending you in midair using energy blasts that come from my hands."
Blossom says: "Huh, good point!"
Bubbles says: "Huh, good point!"
Buttercup says: "Huh, good point!"
Bliss says: "What's going on?"
Bliss says: "I just came here for Towntopia."
Blossom says: "Silico took over the town."
Blossom says: "We gotta stop him, but he's shut off all the technology."
Bliss says: "Hmm."
Bliss says: "There is no way Silico would be out of power."
Bliss says: "Where's the one place that still has electricity?"
The scene switches to a building who still has power with the mind-controlled townspeople who have weapons guarding it.
Blossom says: "Silico must be in there."
Blossom says: "But all the townspeople are guarding it."
Bliss says: "We need a plan."
Bubbles says: "I have just the thing."
Blossom says: "Bubbles, how did you get your Buggly to work?"
Bubbles says: "I reprogrammed it."
Bubbles says: "If I can get this device on Silico, I think I can stop him."
Blossom says: "But we still gotta find a way past the perimeter."
Blossom's Thoughts says: "Perimeter?"
Blossom's Thoughts says: "Is that the right word?"
Blossom's Thoughts says: "I mean, it's a library."
Bliss says: "Don't worry!"
Bliss says: "I got this."
Bliss says: "Let's move before Silico..."
Silico says: "Finds out?"
Silico says: "Oh, look."
Silico says: "All the Powerpuff Girls in one spot."
Silico says: "Now I can destroy you all at once."
Buttercup says: "I don't think so."
All 4 Girls fly up.
Blossom says: "You're going down, Silico!"
Silico says: "It is you who is going down."
Blossom says: "I got it!"
Blossom says: "Yah!"
Blossom says: "Yah!"
Bliss says: "Nice catch!"
Bliss says: "Batter up!"
Buttercup says: "Get ready for a grand slam!"
Silico says: "Strike three, you're out!"
Buttercup says: "The game's not over yet!"
Silico says: "Ha."
Silico says: "Wall!"
Blossom says: "No, you crumble!"
Silico says: "You're gonna have to do better than that."
Bubbles says: "How about this?"
Silico says: "Huh?"
Bliss says: "Bubbles, you did it!"
Silico says: "This doesn't affect me."
Bliss says: "It didn't work!"
Silico says: "No, but this will."
The 4 Girls says: "Huh?"
Silico says: "So long, Powerpuff Girls."
The 4 Girls says: "Oh, no!"
Silico says: "I win."
Silico says: "I win!"
Silico says: "I win!"
Buttercup says: "Wow, Bubbs, good job."
Blossom says: "Yeah, you did it."
Bliss says: "What exactly did you do?"
Bubbles says: "I programmed the Buggly, so now he thinks he beat the Powerpuff Girls."
Buttercup says: "So, he's stuck in a never-ending dream?"
Bubbles says: "Yep!"
Buttercup says: "Bubbles, I mean every word of this -- I'm both impressed and terrified."
Bubbles says: "Thanks!"
Bubbles says: "I guess."
Bliss says: "By the way, where is the Professor?"
The Professor says: "Almost to the top!"
