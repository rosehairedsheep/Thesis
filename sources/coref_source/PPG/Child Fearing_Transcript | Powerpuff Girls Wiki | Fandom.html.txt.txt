Narrator says: "The city of Townsville..."
Narrator says: "where our man Professor is not only guest speaker, but he's also..."
Close-up of the front room window. We see his silhouette running frantically back and forth in a panic at missing the convention.
Professor says: "Late!"
Professor says: "I'm late!"
Inside, he is at the bathroom sink, working quickly.
Professor says: "Got to hurry!"
Professor says: "Got to hurry!"
He brushes his teeth, then grabs his deodorant off the counter and smears it into his hair, unaware he was putting it on the wrong area. Next he picks up a can of hair spray and squirts himself under each arm - while still wearing his white lab coat, again unaware of the mistake due to his panic. The girls are waiting at the foot of the stairs; he rushes down, holding his briefcase and with all this mess still on him.
Professor says: "Bye, girls!"
Blossom says: "Oh, Professor!"
Professor says: "What?"
Blossom says: "Forgot your hat!"
She produces it from behind her back; he bends down and she puts it on his head.
Professor says: "Thanks."
Professor says: "Bye!"
He dashes o.c. again; we hear the door slam. The girls exchange knowing glances with one another. After a few seconds, we hear the door open and the Professor runs across the room in front of them. The sound of a phone being dialed is heard, and the camera pulls back to show him making a call, with the girls still at the foot of the stairs.
Buttercup says: "Forget the babysitter?"
Professor says: "No, no, I forgot the babysitter."

Mayor says: "Ohhh!"
Mayor says: "Blast it!"
Mayor says: "Oh, rats!"
Mayor says: "Darn fairy!"
Cut to the exterior of the house. The Professor is in his car, waving goodbye. The girls are just inside the open front door, looking out.
Professor says: "Now, be good, girls, and listen to the babysitter."
Girls says: "We will!"
Girls says: "Good luck!"
They close the door. A moment later there is a loud hammering on it and their eyes pop wide open. We see it from their perspective as it is opened to reveal...
Girls says: "Mojo Jojo?!"
Girls says: "!"
Mojo says: "That is correct!"
Mojo says: "It is I, Mojo Jojo, who is  take..."
Mojo says: "over..."
Mojo says: "Townsville!"
The girls, standing in Mojo's shadow, glance worriedly at each other for a long moment before finally speaking, but what they reply with is not the reply Mojo was looking for.
Girls says: "WE'RE HUNGRY!"
Mojo says: "Perhaps you did not hear me."
Girls says: "DINNER TIME!"
Mojo says: "Okay, okay, okay."
Mojo says: "If you want dinner, you will get dinner."
Mojo says: "But after you eat, you will, without hesitation, help me take over Townsville!"
Mojo says: "Now, girls, prepare to have your taste buds delighted."
Mojo says: "for I, Mojo Jojo, am not only number-one villain in Townsville, but am also..."
Quick pan to the kitchen. Mojo is now dressed in a chef's uniform.
Mojo says: "..."
Mojo says: "number-one chef in Townsville!"
Mojo says: "Huy!"
He snaps a salute and wheels in a Japanese-style grill, stopping it in front of the girls and turning on the flame. Next, he pulls out two spatulas and does a bit of fancy twirling before setting them down in front of him. He throws a bottle of cooking oil high into the air, catches it in his other hand, and squirts some onto the grill. As the girls watch, amazed, he pulls out two knives, strops them against one another, and throws them toward the ceiling. Without waiting to catch them, he whips out a fish and slaps it a couple of times before depositing it, some cucumbers, and a handful of shrimp on the grill. Pounding the surface, he causes two containers of seasoning to fly over his head and come down in his hands on opposite sides. He places them and two other shakers in front of him, then quickly shuffles them all as in the old shell game. All this and what follows is punctuated with cries of "Huy!".
Close-up of the girls, still watching in amazement. They look up and gasp in fear; cut to the knives, still spinning in midair. They finally come down, and Mojo catches one in each hand. He dices the cucumbers, then spreads the pieces all over the grill by hitting the surface.
Girls says: "Yay!"
Mojo moves the pile of vegetables aside and slices the fish, then sets a bowl of sauce in front of each of the girls.
Mojo says: "Huy!"
Mojo says: "For dipping."
Mojo says: "Next, the shrimp."
He flips the shrimp up, seasons them in midair, and slings two onto each girl's plate after they hit the grill again. Helpings of fish and vegetables are delivered in like manner, after which Mojo slams his knife and spatula down.
Mojo says: "Huy!"
Mojo says: "Please."
Bubbles picks up a shrimp in her chopsticks and dips it into the sauce. Mojo's eyes pop open, and he rushes over to stop her before she can eat.
Mojo says: "No dipping shrimp!"
Mojo says: "Fish only!"
He backs off. Bubbles eats her other shrimp, and Blossom and Buttercup follow suit. Cut to Mojo, with a nervous, expectant expression; he is waiting for their opinion - and he gets it in the form of three mouthfuls of chewed-up food spat into his face. The girls cough and gag. They apparently did not like the food, despite being impressed by Mojo's prep work with cooking and serving it.
Girls says: "This food stinks!"
Mojo says: "What?!"
Mojo says: "!"
Girls says: "GAME TIME!"
Cut to the hallway. The girls have hold of Mojo and are flying him along; he is now back in his normal outfit.
Mojo says: "No!"
Mojo says: "As your babysitter, I say it's time to take over Townsville!"
Blossom says: "Okay!"
The girls stop and hold Mojo above the floor. Buttercup rips a strip from his cape.
Bubbles says: "But first we have to play our favorite game."
Buttercup says: "Blind hide-and-seek!"
Mojo says: "What?!"
Mojo says: "!"
Mojo says: "What are you doing?"
Pull back to show Blossom and Buttercup hovering around Mojo. He has now been set down.
Blossom says: "To win the game, you got to find Bubbles."
Pull back farther to show her standing apart from the group on the end of this line, then zoom in again.
Blossom says: "Ready?"
Blossom says: "Set?"
Blossom says: "Go!"
Mojo says: "Okay."
Mojo says: "But as soon as I find her, we take over Townsville!"
He begins to stumble around randomly. After a few seconds, Buttercup rushes in and pushes him down; her sisters join her, giggling.
Mojo says: "Curses!"
Now he makes his way slowly o.c. left. Cut to in front of Mojo. Blossom is behind his left shoulder, Buttercup his right. They are still giggling.
Buttercup says: "She's in the next room!"
Mojo turns to his right, our left, and runs flat into a wall.
Mojo says: "Ooh!"
Mojo says: "Curses!"
Blossom says: "No, the other room!"
Mojo turns around and runs through an open door. We hear banging and clattering.
Mojo says: "Curses!"
There is a final crash, and the two girls zip into the doorway. Camera shifts to inside the laundry room, looking up the stairs that Mojo has just fallen down. He is sprawled out on the floor; Blossom and Buttercup are near the door.
Blossom says: "Oops!"
Blossom says: "Sorry!"
We see the top of Mojo's braincap as he climbs the stairs. Cut to the lawn. Mojo runs through the front door and into the street, where a police car is approaching. Close-up of the two cops inside.
Driver says: "So this monkey, he walks into the room and—"
There is a crash, and the camera shakes. When it subsides, he starts again, unfazed.
Driver says: "So, like I said, this monkey..."
The braincap rattles on the pavement like a loose hubcap as the police car drives off. It is clear that Mojo stumbled right into the police car's path and was run over by it.
Inside the house, the girls are entertaining themselves. Blossom is bouncing on a horsey ball, Bubbles is stringing toilet paper everywhere, and Buttercup is turning cartwheels, thinking they got rid of Mojo for a good while. They are interrupted by the sound of the door opening. Pull back to reveal Mojo in the doorway, his back to the camera, then turn around for a head-on view. He looks as bad as he usually does after going three rounds with the girls.
Mojo says: "Forget taking over Townsville."
Mojo says: "Just please go to bed."
The girls jump up in his face, knocking him to the floor a third time.
Girls says: "TV TIME!"
Close-up of them, all talking excitedly at once about wanting to watch their favorite show, then an extreme close-up of Mojo's braincap. We can hear the kettle boiling over in his head, and after a few seconds he tips his face up into view.
Mojo says: "ALL RIGHT!"
Mojo says: "Please, if it’ll make you shut up, watch TV."
Girls says: "Yay!"
They slide across the floor and stop in front of the TV, with Bubbles holding the remote. Mojo settles into a chair behind and facing away from them.
Mojo says: "Ahhh..."
Mojo says: "peace and quiet."
From behind the girls' heads, we see what they are watching - a show featuring what appears to be a big green plaid dragon wearing bunny ears. It speaks with an Irish accent.
Dragon says: "Top o' the mornin', kids."
Dragon says: "It's me, Blarney, the singin' sea serpent."
Dragon says: "Bet you can't guess what I be."
Blarney says: "Aye."
Blarney says: "A bunny rabbit."
Blarney says: "Why don't we sing a bunny rabbit song?"
A happy little melody starts up, and Blarney begins bobbing his head back and forth. The girls, and even finally Mojo, do the same.
Blarney says: "🎵HOP!"
Blarney says: "HOP!"
Blarney says: "HOP!"
Blarney says: "..."
Blarney says: "HOP!"
Blarney says: "HOP!"
Blarney says: "HOP!"
Blarney says: "..."
Blarney says: "HOP!"
Blarney says: "HOP!"
Blarney says: "HOP!"
Blarney says: "..."
Blarney says: "HOP!"
Blarney says: "HOP!"
Blarney says: "HOP!"
He jumps up and down, and the girls do likewise on all fours - landing hard enough to shake the whole house and everything in it, including Mojo. Close-up of Blarney again; now he has traded the bunny ears for a rhinoceros horn.
Blarney says: "🎵STOMP!"
Blarney says: "STOMP!"
Blarney says: "STOMP!"
Blarney says: "..."
Blarney says: "STOMP!"
Blarney says: "STOMP!"
Blarney says: "STOMP!"
Blarney says: "..."
Blarney says: "STOMP!"
Blarney says: "STOMP!"
Blarney says: "STOMP!"
Now he stomps his feet, and the girls do the same, once again shaking the entire house, including Mojo. Close-up of Blarney once again; now he has ditched the horn and strapped a fish head to his snout.
Blarney says: "🎵SCREAM!"
Blarney says: "SCREAM!"
Blarney says: "SCREAM!"
Blarney says: "..."
Blarney says: "SCREAM!"
Blarney says: "SCREAM!"
Blarney says: "SCREAM!"
Blarney says: "..."
Blarney says: "SCREAM!"
Blarney says: "SCREAM!"
Blarney says: "SCREAM!"
The girls do what the song says, causing Mojo to stuff his fingers in his ears as he grinds his teeth, making them crack. It is clear the show the Girls selected was meant to drive him even more bonkers with their behavior. Back to the girls at the TV.
Blarney says: "Ok, lads and lassies."
Blarney says: "Now let's all join in."
Bubbles shoots a look at Blossom as if to say, "Are you thinking what I'm thinking?". Blossom passes the look to Buttercup, who looks with wicked delight o.c. Quick pan over to a truly terrified Mojo.
Mojo says: "Oh, no!"
Mojo says: "No!"
Mojo says: "No!"
He is zipped out of his chair and over to the TV, where Blarney continues to sing and produces appropriate props and actions for each line.
Blarney says: "🎵If I were a log, I'd ROLL!"
Blarney says: "ROLL!"
Blarney says: "ROLL!"
Mojo says: "Stop!"
Mojo says: "What are you doing?"
Mojo says: "Wait!"
Blarney says: "🎵If I were a ball, I'd BOUNCE!"
Blarney says: "BOUNCE!"
Blarney says: "BOUNCE!"
Mojo says: "Help!"
Mojo says: "I do not like this!"
Blarney says: "🎵If I were a rake, I'd RAKE!"
Blarney says: "RAKE!"
Blarney says: "RAKE!"
The girls yank Mojo outside, grab him by the legs, and use his teeth to rake the lawn.
Blarney says: "🎵If I were a hammer, I'd POUND!"
Blarney says: "POUND!"
Blarney says: "POUND!"
The girls yank Mojo back inside and slam him headfirst against a block of wood.
Blarney says: "🎵If I were a candle, I'd..."
Mojo says: "ENOUGH!"
Mojo says: "I HAVE HAD IT!"
Mojo says: "IT'S..."
Mojo says: "BED!!"
He throws them onto the bed; Bubbles and Buttercup land in each other's sections. Close-up of him as he turns to leave, wiping his forehead in relief at finally getting them to bed so he can finally relax and regain whatever sanity he has left until the Professor gets home.
Mojo says: "Whew!"
Mojo says: "Finally."
Mojo says: "Mojo get peace."
Buttercup says: "Where are you going?"
Cut to the girls in bed, now wearing their nightgowns.
Bubbles says: "Aren't you going to read us a story?"
Blossom says: "We can't sleep without a story!"
Buttercup says: "Yeah!"
Pull back to show Mojo at the doorway, crying and whimpering, his back to the girls. It is clear this is not what he wanted with him on his last shred of sanity, and this only is making him think to himself, "When will this torture end...?". He turns around.
Mojo says: "But only if you go to sleep!"
The girls nod and point toward the side of the bed. He sits down on a stool there.
Mojo says: "Very well, then."
Mojo says: "I will tell you my favorite story..."
Mojo says: "about the greatest conqueror who ever lived, Napoleon!"
(A mental picture appears above Mojo's head says: "the French dictator, looking very monkey-like, with his country's flag behind him."
(A mental picture appears above Mojo's head says: "As the story begins, zoom in on this view."
(A mental picture appears above Mojo's head says: ")"
Mojo says: "He was a mighty man, feared by all who looked up to him."
Napoleon stands on a pedestal in front of a group of saluting soldiers. Cut back to Mojo, who continues telling his story at top speed.
Behind him is a map of the continent in his mental picture; it lights up green. Cut to a full-screen map of Asia.
Mojo says: "and finally the whole world."
Mojo says: "The end."
Girls says: "BORING!"
The mental picture cracks and shatters, leaving Mojo standing there shocked in the bedroom. Blossom jumps out of bed, holding her pillow.
Blossom says: "Your story's all wrong!"
Blossom says: "Napoleon's 1807 seizure of Portugal and the subsequent rebellion by the Spaniards cost France over 300,000 casualties, untold sums of money, and contributed to the eventual weakening of the Napoleonic empire!"
She hits him with the pillow. Bubbles jumps out of bed, carrying hers.
Bubbles says: "And your analysis on the invasion of Russia is also incorrect!"
Bubbles says: "Napoleon's invasion of 1812 resulted in massive casualties of his troops, due to starvation and inclement conditions, and ended in a disastrous retreat from Moscow with his army defeated!"
She socks him with the pillow. Buttercup jumps to the floor with hers.
Buttercup says: "Yeah, dummy!"
Buttercup says: "And when he returned to France, the allied nations of Europe united against him, which led to his eventual defeat at the Battle of Waterloo on June 18, 1815, whereafter he was exiled to the island of St."
Buttercup says: "Helena, where he died a miserable death from stomach cancer on May 5, 1821, stupid!"
She lets him have it with the pillow, then all three start swinging. They chase Mojo out of the room, into the hall, and o.c. left as he cries out and yells during the next line. Feathers float back into view; on the end of the line, he bolts down the stairs.
Mojo says: "No!"
Mojo says: "Stop!"
Mojo says: "I do not like this!"
Mojo says: "I ordered you to stop!"
Mojo says: "Aah!"
Mojo says: "Owww!"
Mojo says: "No!"
Mojo says: "I command you to stop!"
Now he dashes to the phone and dials, looking frantically back over his shoulder, knowing that the Girls could be coming any second to continue pummeling him with their pillows. As soon as someone answers, his next line makes it clear he wants to return to his prison cell ASAP.
Mojo says: "Help!"
Mojo says: "Please save me!"
Buttercup says: "There he is!"
Cut to the girls flying in with their pillows to continue the pillow fight against Mojo, faces locked in malicious grins. They stop short as their faces go slack with confusion, look down at what they are holding, then look up at each other. After a moment, their faces take on malicious smiles again, they throw the pillows aside and close in. Mojo begins taking the usual beating, but it is interrupted by the doorbell. He races to answer it. Outside are the same two cops who ran him over earlier; he falls to his knees, his hands outstretched eagerly, and is cuffed. It is clear he called them to take him back to prison and away from the Girls. Cut to the paddy wagon, its back doors open to receive Mojo, who is about to be tossed in. The girls rush up and deliver a few last licks before this happens.
Inside the wagon, Mojo is lying on his side and laughing insanely.
Mojo says: "Ooh, yeah!"
Mojo says: "Free at last!"
The two cops climb into the front of the wagon and drive off. As it rolls down the street away from the camera, the girls wave after it.
Girls says: "Bye, Mojo!"
Girls says: "Bye!"
Girls says: "Thanks for all the fun!"
Cut to the driveway, where the Professor has just pulled up. The Girls are momentarily startled and scared when they realize he just returned from his conference while seeing off their babysitter.
Professor says: "Girls, what are you doing outside?"
Blossom says: "We were..."
Blossom says: "uh..."
Blossom says: "just saying goodnight to the babysitter."
Professor says: "Oh, my little angels."
Professor says: "But it's time for bed now."
He walks o.c., carrying his briefcase. The girls float up into the air and high-five each other.
The standard end shot comes up.
Narrator says: "And so once again, the day is saved, thanks to the Powerpuff Girls!"
Narrator says: "The End!"
Narrator says: "We’ll see you again soon!"
