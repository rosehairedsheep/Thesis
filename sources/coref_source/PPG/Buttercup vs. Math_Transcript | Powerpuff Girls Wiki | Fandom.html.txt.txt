Theme Song.
Buttercup and Maylyn come running into Midway Elementary School, skating.
Buttercup says: "Yeah!"
Maylyn says: "First one to math class gets the title of baddest girl in school!"
Buttercup says: "Huh!"
Buttercup says: "And I get to call Blossom a nerd?"
Maylyn says: "Huh!"
Maylyn says: "Youâ€™re on!"
Maylyn says: "Later, loser!"
Buttercup says: "Take that!"
Ms. Keane says: "Buttercup!"
Buttercup says: "Huh?"
Ms. Keane says: "You are not to come to this class ever again!"
Ms. Keane says: "Honors Math."
Maylyn says: "Honors Math?!"
Maylyn says: "!"
Buttercup says: "Honors Math?"
Blossom says: "Honors Math?"
Bubbles says: "Honors Math?"
Buttercup says: "Oh, hey, guys."
Maylyn says: "Nerd."
Blossom says: "Oh, thank you."
Ms. Keane says: "You tested into Honors Math!"
Buttercup says: "I did?"
Blossom says: "Wow."
Blossom says: "Well, Buttercup, I have to say I'm pretty surprised."
Blossom says: "But these years have happened."
Blossom says: "Now, let's go."
Blossom says: "Don't wanna be late on our first day of Honors Math."
Ms. Keane says: "Her first day."
Ms. Keane says: "Blossom, you're in regular math with everyone else."
Blossom says: "Everyone else?!"
Blossom says: "!"
Bubbles says: "Hey, I'm with everyone else."
Bubbles says: "Let's go."
Bubbles says: "Time to fill our heads with numbers."
Ms. Keane says: "Come on, Maylyn, class is about to start."
Maylyn says: "Oh, man, I am so confused."
Buttercup says: "It's just a stupid class."
Buttercup says: "I'm still the baddest girl in school."
Buttercup says: "It's not gonna change my image."
Male Teacher says: "Every time a mathmagician is added to our ranks, they get to wear the math crown."
Buttercup says: "Need to or have to?"
Male Teacher says: "So why don't you use your mathamagical wand and solve for x."
Buttercup says: "Hm."
Buttercup says: "No thanks."
Pimple Faced Boy says: "Hey, the mathamagical wand is actually your pencil."
Pimple Faced Boy says: "My pencil chose me."
Pimple Faced Boy says: "We've been through many mathamagical battles together."
Pimple Faced Boy says: "Why, it was just the other day..."
Buttercup says: "Can you just like..."
Buttercup says: "not?"
Light Brown-Skinned Boy says: "Ooh, ooh, I know the answer."
Light Brown-Skinned Boy says: "8!"
Girl With Braces says: "3."
Girl With Braces says: "56."
Buttercup says: "5!!!"
Buttercup says: "The answer is 5, people!"
Male Teacher says: "Correct."
Male Teacher says: "Would you like to tell the class how you got that?"
Buttercup says: "Uhhhhh..."
Buttercup says: "I just did it in my head or whatever."
Pimple Faced Boy says: "You didn't even use your mathamagical wand?!"
Pimple Faced Boy says: "!"
Buttercup says: "STOP SAYING THAT!!"
Professor says: "Oh, Buttercup, we're just so proud of you, honey."
Buttercup says: "This is lame!"
Buttercup says: "Isn't Bubbles the computer geek?"
Bubbles says: "Buttercup, there is a large difference between computer science and math."
Bubbles says: "Allow me to illuminate."
Buttercup says: "No."
Buttercup says: "Bloss, help me out here."
Blossom says: "I can't."
Blossom says: "This true math queen is studying to retake the quizlet exam."
Blossom says: "I'm sure there was a mistake."
Blossom says: "Ask me anything, ANYTHING!!"
Bubbles says: "What's 2+2?"
Buttercup says: "Yikes."
Buttercup says: "See?"
Buttercup says: "We already have one nerd in this family!"
The Professor says: "Thank you."
Blossom says: "Thank you."
Buttercup says: "Can I just be the tough one like I'm supposed to be?"
Professor says: "Buttercup, remember, you define yourself."
Professor says: "And who's to say you can't be good at 2 things?"
Professor says: "Why, back in my day, I used to be an organic and inorganic chemist."
Professor says: "Oh, people didn't know what to do with me."
Professor says: "Have a great day at school, girls."
Blossom says: "Bye, Professor."
Bubbles says: "Bye, Professor."
Buttercup says: "Uh, wait, Professor, I can't go to math today."
Professor says: "You can't?"
Buttercup says: "'Cause, uh, the teacher hates greens, says my hair sticks up too much, and..."
Buttercup says: "and I can't see because the board is too far away."
Professor says: "Hmm."
The school doors open alerting the students, with Buttercup at the entrance with her hair short like a boy's and her cowlick sticking out in the back, wearing big, blue glasses, a green business suit with a light yellow skinny rectangle detail in the middle, which is close to the bottom of the suit, with a white detail under her neck lastly with a red tie, holding a math book in her right arm.
Professor says: "All better now."
Professor says: "Love you, pumpkin."
Buttercup says: "Well, that backfired."
Maylyn says: "Said it wouldn't change your image, huh?"
Buttercup says: "I..."
Maylyn says: "Come on, Derbytantes."
Maylyn says: "First one to lunch is the baddest girl in school."
Buttercup says: "THAT IS IT!"
Buttercup says: "I'm never gonna do it again."
Bubbles says: "Buttercup?"
Blossom says: "Ooh, I like the new look."
Bubbles says: "Wow."
Bubbles says: "Barry is really struggling with that show and tell."
The grid continues to extend as the kids, including Buttercup, Bubbles, and Blossom, in the cafeteria fall onto the grid floor.
Pimple Faced Brown-Haired Boy says: "Ooh, sloppy joes."
Pimple Faced Brown-Haired Boy says: "Aw, man."
Blossom says: "Hey, what's going on?"
Eyesoceles says: "I am Eyesoceles!"
Eyesoceles says: "I am here to take your stupid, messy human society and organize it into one method equation!"
Blossom says: "But why?"
Eyesoceles says: "So that there will be order in the universe!"
Maylyn says: "Hey, Butlyn, friend of yours?"
Eyesoceles says: "SILENCE!"
Maylyn says: "Oh!"
Maylyn says: "My skates!"
Mayor says: "Hey, I'm a number 6!"
A puppy is shown and Bubbles floats down to him as he is turned into an acute angle and barks.
Bubbles says: "Oh, my, what a cute angle!"
Bubbles says: "Oh!"
Bubbles says: "Uh-oh."
Eyesoceles says: "I am now the most complicated equation ever!"
Eyesoceles says: "Unsolved by any pathetic human brain."
Blossom says: "Unsolvable?"
Buttercup says: "Please do."
Blossom says: "I'll solve you in a fraction of a second."
Blossom says: "Hmm."
Blossom says: "Um..."
Blossom says: "6?"
Eyesoceles says: "Wrong."
Blossom says: "What?"
Blossom says: "Give me another chance!"
Eyesoceles says: "What about you?"
Eyesoceles says: "You think you're gonna use your stupid puny brain to crack this equation?"
Buttercup says: "I will definitely crack this equation."
Eyesoceles says: "Physical effort is no match for Eyesoceles!"
Eyesoceles says: "You'll have to use your tiny little brain."
Blossom says: "Buttercup, the only way to stop him is by solving the equation!"
Bubbles says: "You can do it."
Bubbles says: "You're in Honors Math!"
Pimple Faced Boy says: "That's right."
Pimple Faced Boy says: "You're the Math Queen."
Buttercup says: "All right."
Buttercup says: "If it's the Math Queen you want, it's Math Queen you'll get."
Eyesoceles says: "Prepare to meet your dividend, little girl, and I'll  make sure it is show my work."
Buttercup says: "Time to solve for x."
Eyesoceles says: "That's it!"
Eyesoceles says: "Your number is up!"
Eyesoceles says: "You're mean."
Eyesoceles says: "Huh."
Eyesoceles says: "Guess you solved the unsolvable equa..."
Bubbles says: "You did it, Buttercup."
Buttercup says: "I guess I can be good at math and punching."
Bubbles says: "You're like..."
Bubbles says: "a mathlete."
Maylyn and the other Derbytantes skate up to Buttercup.
Maylyn says: "So you really are going by mathlete now?"
Buttercup says: "Sometimes."
Buttercup says: "Why are you so weird about me being good at math anyways?"
Maylyn says: "Because..."
Maylyn says: "because..."
Maylyn says: "I'm just so bad at it."
Maylyn says: "."
Bobbysuzyraelyn says: "Can you help us with our homework?"
Blossom says: "And maybe me, too."
Everyone chants "Mathlete".
