Narrator says: "The city of Townsville!"
Close-up of the Mayor's fist in the air.
Mayor says: "I have a dream!"
Back to the skyline, turning down toward the street.
Narrator says: "A city of growth and prosperity."
Extreme close-up of the Mayor's face, turning up toward his raised hand.
Mayor says: "Of the people, for the people, and by the people!"
Pan along the skyline.
Narrator says: "A city run by one man."
Pan slowly across the Mayor\s face.
Mayor says: "That we, the citizens of Townsville..."
The steps of Townsville Hall, turning up toward its dome.
Narrator says: "A man of strength and integrity."
Close-up of the Mayor from behind, turning up toward his head. He is at a podium.
Mayor says: "..."
Mayor says: "promise to uphold the virtues of our city."
The dome, seen from between other buildings.
Narrator says: "Yes, this city."
Narrator says: "..."
Narrator says: "the Mayor!"
Mayor says: "And furthermore..."
Mayor says: "Ich bin ein Townsviller!"
Pull back to the sound of clapping. He stands on his desk in the office, facing Ms. Bellum.
Ms. Bellum says: "Uh..."
Ms. Bellum says: "that was quite a speech, Mayor."
Ms. Bellum says: "But why did you even bother writing it?"
Ms. Bellum says: "No one's running against you."
Ms. Bellum says: "No one ever does."
Mayor says: "Oh, my dear girl!"
Mayor says: "If George Washington used snails instead of greyhounds to pull his sled, there'd be no trees for Honest Abe to shove from the highest mountain."
Ms. Bellum says: "What?"
Mayor says: "That's right!"
(Balloons says: ""VOTE FOR MAYOR FOR MAYOR."
streamers rain down says: ""VOTE FOR MAYOR FOR MAYOR."
the scene changes to a large campaign banner strung up outside says: ""VOTE FOR MAYOR FOR MAYOR."
Mayor says: "Vote for Mayor for Mayor!"
Mayor says: "Vote for Mayor for Mayor!"
Pan across the city as he repeats this 'slogan' over and over; the farther out we go, the more his voice echoes. Stop on the forest outside Townsville and zoom in; the trees part to reveal Fuzzy Lumkins' shack. Inside, Fuzzy is asleep in his bed. He suddenly wakes up, looking very angry. Back to the Mayor.
Mayor says: "Vote for Mayor for Mayor!"
Fuzzy says: "I says, shut up!"
Quick series of close-ups of surprised onlookers, including the Talking Dog and the Mayor himself, then pull back to show Fuzzy facing the Mayor from the back of the crowd.
Man says: ""Shut up"?"
Man says: "..."
Man says: ""Shut up"?"
Man says: "..."

Man says: "Yeah!"
Man says: "I like it!"

Woman 1 says: "And straightforward."
Woman 2 says: "He's got my vote!"
Man says: "Yeah!"
Man says: "Fuzzy should run for Mayor!"
Talking Dog says: "Yeah!"
Woman 1 says: "Yeah!"
Woman 2 says: "Yeah!"
Mayor says: "No."

Fuzzy says: "GET OFFA MY..."
Fuzzy says: "Huh?"
He realizes it's just a newspaper and reads it. Now we see it with the aforementioned headline and a picture of a rather bleary Fuzzy. He drops it and smiles broadly. Dissolve to him in the Mayor's office, pointing and laughing stupidly at the loser of the election, then cut to outside Townsville Hall. The Mayor crashes through the window and lands headfirst, well away from the city, as the laughter continues. Back in the office, Fuzzy - now dressed in a much larger version of the Mayor's suit - lowers the small top hat onto his head. Pull back from him, sitting behind an old wooden crate for a desk. The office is strewn with worn-out tires, chickens, and random junk - an instant bit of the backwoods. Dissolve to the Mayor, sitting dejected and disheveled among garbage far from the city. He whimpers softly as a bird lands near him. Fade to black.
Snap to an intercom speaker on Fuzzy's desk.
Fuzzy says: "Bel-LUM!"
Fuzzy says: "Scoot your purty little self in here, and let's take a gander at you!"
Ms. Bellum says: "Do I have to?"
Fuzzy says: "I said..."
Fuzzy says: "..."
Fuzzy says: "sco-OOT!"
Cut to the office door at floor level. Ms. Bellum steps into view, in bare feet rather than her customary red high heels. Turn up to show her red suit gone; she wears denim cutoffs, with a piece of rope for a belt, and a short white top with red polka dots tied in front. Her hair is in two pigtails. Fuzzy lets off a wolf whistle from o.c. Cut back and forth between the two of them.
Ms. Bellum says: "Charming."
Ms. Bellum says: "Is there anything else I can do for you, Mayor?"
Fuzzy says: "Wha-a-at?"
Ms. Bellum says: "Well, uh, howdy, Your Fuzziness."
Ms. Bellum says: "Is thar anything else I can do fer ye?"
Fuzzy says: "Hoo doggie, I likes that!"
Fuzzy says: "Oh, yeah!"
Fuzzy says: "Oh, yeah!"
Fuzzy says: "I almost forgotted."
Fuzzy says: "I gots me an emergency!"
Fuzzy says: "What am I 'posed to do?"
Ms. Bellum says: "Well, first off..."
Cut to Fuzzy, who clears his throat, then back to her.
Ms. Bellum says: "I reckon you all should call them thar Powerpuff Girls."
Close-up of the hotline, buzzing. Pull back as Blossom picks it up. She is in the bedroom.
Blossom says: "Um..."
Blossom says: "howdy."
Blossom says: "This is Blossom."
Blossom says: "Pardon me?"
Blossom says: "Mayor, it sounds like you're talking into a..."
Close-up of a tin can in Fuzzy's hand. Pull back to show him yelling into it; a string emerges from its base.
Fuzzy says: "I gots an emergency!"
Fuzzy says: "Get here quick!"
There is a crash o.c.; he turns around, and we see the girls standing in the office below the hole they have just smashed in the ceiling. Back to Fuzzy.
Fuzzy says: "Help me catch my pig!"
A squealing porker runs past the girls, and they give chase all over the office, flying in different directions. Blossom and Bubbles crash into each other, and Buttercup is knocked into the air as the pig escapes through an open door. Extreme close-up of Fuzzy, tin can in hand.
Fuzzy says: "Emergency!"
Cut to Blossom in the office, scrubbing laundry on a washboard. Pan over to Bubbles, who is working the wringer, then to a long clothesline festooned with a wet wash. Buttercup is at the far end, hanging up the clothes. None of them look particularly happy with this assignment. Extreme close-up of Fuzzy's mouth as he yells into the can.
Fuzzy says: "Emergency!"
Cut to an old jalopy in the office, its hood up. Blossom wrenches on the engine. We see Buttercup milking a goat, then Bubbles squeezing a potato for juice - a feedstock for moonshine vodka, perhaps. Again they look quite displeased. Extreme close-up of Fuzzy, yelling.
Fuzzy says: "E-MER-GEN-CY!"
Now the girls appear in hillbilly clothes, playing as a washboard band. Blossom plucks a makeshift bass built from a washtub, broom handle, and piece of rope. Buttercup plays the board, and Bubbles blows into an empty jug. Pan from them to Fuzzy; he claps his hands and stomps his foot - this is heaven for him. After a few moments, he reaches o.c, then comes up with his banjo and starts to play along with them. Fade to black.
Fade into the exterior of the girls' house and zoom in slowly. Inside, turn down from the bedroom windows as Blossom speaks. The girls are sprawled out on the floor. Bubbles blows wearily into a jug.
Blossom says: "Here, pig..."
Blossom says: "Soo-wee, pig..."
Blossom says: "Piggy pig..."
Buttercup says: "We haven't fought crime in weeks."
Buttercup says: "And if I have to milk another goat, I'm gonna be sick!"
Blossom says: "Fuzzy isn't a real Mayor."
Blossom says: "He doesn't care about our town, he only cares about himself."
Buttercup says: "Yeah."
Buttercup says: "Mayor or not, we gotta impeach Fuzzy and get our old Mayor back."
Bubbles says: "But..."
Bubbles says: "we don't know where he is."
Blossom says: "No, but we know someone who does."
Close-up of the tin-can "phone" in Fuzzy's office. It begins to rattle. Cut to him asleep on a run-down bed; Ms. Bellum, seen from the knees down, tiptoes into view past him and stops at the stand the can sits on. She picks it up.
Ms. Bellum says: "Thank goodness it's you, girls!"
Ms. Bellum says: "..."
Ms. Bellum says: "Yes..."
Ms. Bellum says: "Yes, of course."
Ms. Bellum says: "Meet me at the park outside of town in fifteen minutes."
Wipe to a bird pulling at what appears to be a blade of grass. Pull back to show it on top of the Mayor's head - the "grass" is a strand of his hair. This bird is the one that landed next to him after he was kicked out of his old office.
Blossom says: "Mayor!"
Blossom says: "We found you!"
Blossom says: "We need you back, Mayor."
Blossom says: "You need to run Townsville again!"
Mayor says: "I'm all washed up, girls."
Mayor says: "Nobody wants me as Mayor anymore."
Buttercup says: "But we don't get to fight crime anymore!"
Mayor says: "I don't care."
Bubbles says: "He's turned your office into a pigsty - literally!"
Mayor says: "I don't care."
Blossom says: "He's tarnishing the image of what it is to be the Mayor!"
Mayor says: "I don't care."
Ms. Bellum says: "He's wearing your hat."
Cut to inside Fuzzy's office; the Mayor kicks the door open. The little man is hopping mad.
Mayor says: "FUZZY!!"
He begins to cross the room; passing the items he mentions in sequence.
Mayor says: "You can throw away my things, and I don't mind the hay on the floor, and the chicken wire's a nice touch, and I kinda like that beat-up old flivver."
Mayor says: "But no one, I mean no one, wears my mayorin' hat!"
Mayor says: "Now give it back!"
Fuzzy says: "I'll wrestle it for you."
Close-up of a bell being rung to start a fight. Pull back to show an arena full of cheering spectators, with a wrestling ring in the middle. Flashbulbs pop all around.
Announcer says: "Ladies and gentlemen!"
Close-up of a referee, microphone in hand. He is calling the fight.
Announcer says: "In this corner, weighing in at 95 pounds, defending his title as Mayor and his hat: ex-Mayor, Mayor!"
Pan quickly in the direction he is pointing. The Mayor stands in that corner and waves timidly; he has stripped down to trunks and undershirt. The crowd cheers wildly. Back to the referee.
Referee says: "And in this corner, weighing in at 250 pounds, the present Mayor: Fuzzy Lumkins!"
Pan to him in the opposite corner of the ring, dressed in his overalls and the top hat and ready for a scrap. The crowd boos him.
Fuzzy says: "Don't forgets my kin..."
In time with the next line, three other creatures step into view. The first appears on his right and is tall and thin. The second, on his left, is very fat. Fuzzy lifts his leg to allow the third - very short, with pink fur on his head and white on his body - to come forward. The fat and skinny ones wear overalls like Fuzzy's.
Fuzzy says: "..."
Fuzzy says: "Furry, Fluffy, and Hairy!"
Mayor says: "Hey!"
Mayor says: "That's not fair!"
Fuzzy says: "If you wrestles one Lumkin, you wrestles 'em all!"
Mayor says: "But it's four against one!"
Fuzzy says: "Oh, all right, fine."
Fuzzy says: "Pick someone!"
Mayor says: "Oh, well, okay."
Mayor says: "Then I pick..."
Cut to his perspective of the girls, panning across them to the Professor, and stop on him.
Mayor says: "..."
Mayor says: "uh..."
Mayor says: "Professor Utonium!"
Professor says: "What?"
Blossom says: "What?"
Buttercup says: "What?"
Bubbles says: "What?"
Mayor says: "What?"
Professor says: "What's wrong with you?!"
Professor says: "!"
Professor says: "Take my girls, please!"
Mayor says: "No, no, no."
Mayor says: "Get up here, Professor, and show Fuzzy what for!"
[Dialogue/animation goof says: "In this sequence, the girls are shown speaking in the following order: Buttercup, Bubbles, Blossom."
The Professor climbs nervously into the ring. No sooner does he stand upright than a huge pink fist slams into the side of his head for a knockout punch. He is reduced to a shaking wreck on the canvas; the Mayor watches uneasily as two paramedics carry him away on a stretcher. The Professor groans softly.
Mayor says: "Thanks a lot."
The bell rings. Fuzzy picks the Mayor up, spins him in one hand, and throws him across the ring. He hits one of the ropes, which catapults him back to slam into Fuzzy's rear end. He tumbles to the canvas. A tag is exchanged, and Fluffy, the fat one, rolls back and forth across the Mayor to squash him flat. Another tag is made; now Furry, the thin one, peels the man off the mat and runs across the ring with him. The Mayor is rammed into the corner post face first and thrown down. Furry tags out, and Hairy, the short white one, jumps in and performs a suplex on the Mayor - pulling him up by his shoulders and turning him to slam down on his back.
Fuzzy and his three kinsmen each leap onto a corner post. The Mayor looks around, realizing what they are about to do, and begins to scream. The four leap from their perches toward the center of the ring to deliver the finisher. Cut to the girls, still at ringside.
Blossom says: "Hey!"
Blossom says: "That's not fair!"
In midair, Buttercup plows into Furry, Bubbles rams Hairy, and Blossom charges Fluffy. These three are disposed of in short order. Overhead view of the Mayor, who has continued screaming through all of this and not even noticed the Girls intervene on his behalf. He finally stops and looks around; pan slowly across the ring and the three unconscious fighters, to the sound of wild cheering. Back to the Mayor, who flexes his muscles thinking he did it while screaming.
Mayor says: "Oh!"
Mayor says: "Well, I guess I don't know my own strength."
The words are barely out of his mouth before Fuzzy lands on him. He pokes his head out from underneath the pink oaf as the referee slides in to start the count.
Referee says: "One!"
Fuzzy says: "Well..."
Fuzzy says: "And I get your hat!"
The Mayor's eye pops wide open; Fuzzy slowly lowers the hat toward his head. The referee raises his hand to deliver the second count, and the hat moves closer toward Fuzzy's antennae. Close-up of the Mayor, then of the referee's hand as it hits the mat.
Referee says: "Two!"
The hat continues its descent, and the referee's hand goes up for the third and final count that will end the match and name Fuzzy the winner and remain Mayor. Extreme close-up of the Mayor's monocle, then pull back. Fuzzy has now donned the hat. A low rumble begins to make itself heard, and a very worried look comes over Fuzzy's face as he begins to shake a bit. Suddenly he flies into the air and o.c.
Mayor says: "FUZZY!!"
The referee stops his count and looks up, surprised. Back to the Mayor.
Mayor says: "NOBODY WEARS MY HAT!!"
He tears off his shirt, revealing an impressively bulked-up physique. Fuzzy looks worriedly up at the hat and back to the camera, realizing he's screwed now that he's awoken the beast inside the Mayor and he's going to give Fuzzy one heck of a thrashing.
Mayor says: "Let's get it on."
Before Fuzzy can do anything, the Mayor rushes up, grabs him, and slams him to the mat twice. He administers a pile driver, smashing him headfirst onto the canvas, then delivers several punches to the face of the dazed hick. Now the Mayor backhands him across the face, backs up across the ring, and uses the ropes to sling himself toward his opponent again. He pulls his fist back to deliver a flying punch. The blow spins Fuzzy around and deposits his face up on the mat. Now the Mayor stands atop the corner post, flashing bullhorns with both hands, as the crowd cheers. The camera turns around to show Fuzzy, still prone and dazed, before the little man jumps. Flashbulbs pop behind him as he sails through the air in slow motion. He lands squarely on Fuzzy's midsection. The impact is seen three times at normal speed, zooming in closer each time, after which the green-nosed head falls back in slow motion, hitting the mat with Fuzzy's eyes changing to X's. He's out for the count. The referee leans into view.
Referee says: "One, two, three!"
Referee says: "You're out!"
The crowd cheers once again as more flashbulbs explode all around the ring. Close-up of the Mayor, standing atop the unconscious Fuzzy with his arms raised in triumph. After a moment, his adversary raises his head as he comes to again.
Fuzzy says: "What happened?"
Mayor says: "I'll take that."
Referee says: "..."
Referee says: "and new Mayor, the ex-Mayor, Mayor!"
Pull back; the girls are in the ring as well, looking on, as yet more flashbulbs go off. Cut to a close-up of the home hotline, buzzing. Pull back as Blossom picks it up; her sisters float nearby.
Blossom says: "Yes, Mayor."
Mayor says: "Emergency!"
A crash shakes the camera. The girls are in the office, having smashed in through the ceiling.
Blossom says: "What is it, Mayor?"
Mayor says: "Help me catch my pig!"
On the end of this, a pig runs across in front of him. The girls give chase, with him close behind.
Narrator says: "Oh, Mayor!"
Narrator says: "You've always got my vote."
The standard end shot comes up.
Narrator says: "And so once again the day is saved - thanks to the Powerpuff Girls!"
Narrator says: "Y'all come back now, hear?"
