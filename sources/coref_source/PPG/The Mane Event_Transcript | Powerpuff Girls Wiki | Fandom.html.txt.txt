Narrator says: "The city of Townsville…  …where at this very moment, our girls are tangled in another hair-raising situation!"
Inside, the girls are asleep in their bedroom. Blossom is not wearing her hair bow; this will be true for the next two sequences. Sunlight steals across the scene, illuminating them. Close-up of the top of Bubbles’ head, the rest covered by the blanket. She sits up, and we see that her hair is a total wreck. Cut to the other side of the bed, where a ragged patch of black can be seen. Buttercup wakes up yawning and patting her hair, which also looks like a mess. Pull back to bring the whole bed into a frame; the two look at each other with sleep-clouded eyes, then down at the top of Blossom’s head between them.
Close-up of her as the covers slide away from her head and she slowly opens her eyes. Her sisters watch in disbelief as she sits up and loosens her hair, letting it fall free behind her. She swings her head from side to side, her hair looking quite presentable. The other two exchange a knowing glance while Blossom floats above them, still swinging that curtain of hair.
Dissolve to the girls, now clothed and cleaned up, at the end of the bed. Bubbles and Buttercup are brushing Blossom’s hair.
Bubbles says: "Oh, Blossom, your hair is sooooo beautiful."
As she says this, cut to a close-up of the hair on her side and pan to the ends; they curl and shine when she brushes them. Cut to Blossom.
Buttercup says: "—"
Buttercup says: "and some of this for hold."
She produces a can of hairspray and applies it, causing Blossom to cough.
Buttercup says: "And there you have it."
Buttercup says: "A racetrack with hairpin turns!"
She has constructed a figure-eight track on which several toy cars race around. Bubbles flies into view to look at it.
Bubbles says: "That’s stupid!"
Buttercup says: "Oh—"
Cut to a rabbit made of hair, with two hairclips for eyes and a barrette for a mouth.
Bubbles says: "Yes."
Bubbles says: "Blossom loves Fluffy."
Bubbles says: "Don’t you, Blossom?"
The end of the bed again. Bubbles and Buttercup are enjoying their creations, but Blossom looks quite annoyed. Quick zoom in on her.
Blossom says: "CUT IT OUT!"
Each of the others is surprised by her reaction.
Blossom says: "And give me a real hairdo."
Bubbles says: "Sure, sure."
Bubbles says: "Just gotta comb out a few tangles."
Buttercup says: "And get rid of a…couple of…knots!"

Bubbles says: "Oh!"
Buttercup says: "Oh!"
They look at each other. The camera turns around again.
Blossom says: "What’s going on back there?"
Buttercup says: "Oh—"
Buttercup says: "nothing."
Bubbles says: "Uh—"
Bubbles says: "just gotta trim a few split ends."
The two of them go to work; scraps of hair fly everywhere and collect on the floor by the bed. When they finish, close-up of them, hands to chins in nervous thought. Long silence as they turn their eyes to each other. The buzzing of the hotline breaks their pensive mood. Close-up of it.
Blossom says: "I got it!"
She reaches into view to answer the call, and the camera turns up to her face. Her hairline is not visible above her eyes.
Blossom says: "Yes, Mayor?"
Blossom says: "…Whoa."
Blossom says: "No way!"
Blossom says: "…Right."
Blossom says: "We’re on it!"
Cut to the other two standing at the foot of the bed, to the sound of the phone being hung up. Her shadow advances into view, her hair looking decidedly odd.
Blossom says: "Girls!"
Blossom says: "Trouble!"
Blossom says: "Move out!"
Their cheeks turn bright red and swell up with laughter they are trying desperately to suppress. Extreme close-up of Blossom; pull back to show all of her. Her hair has been randomly chopped short, there is nothing left on top but a single long tuft, and her bow is missing. Long silence.
Blossom says: "What?"
Cut to behind her; we see the others to either side. They shake their heads, still struggling not to laugh out loud.
Blossom says: "Whatever."
Cut to them again, zooming in slowly as tiny bits of hair drift down from above. After a few more seconds of stifling their laughter, they finally let it go. Cut to Blossom in flight.
Narrator says: "Go, girls!"
Narrator says: "Go!"
Bubbles and Buttercup fall in behind Blossom, giggling. In the city, something large, black, and round rises slowly into the sky. People watch, frozen with fear, as its shadow falls over them. The object stops directly in front of the sun, blocking it out entirely. After a long silence, it opens a single huge, glowing blue eye; now the people scream and run. The ball fires a beam from its eye and destroys a building. Several other structures receive the same treatment. Next, a bridge is demolished, followed by a gasoline refinery—Gas Is Best. A tanker on the water is hit, as is the water itself; the tanker is wrecked, and the water evaporates to leave the ship in dry dock.
Two fighter jets fly toward the monster.
Pilot 1 says: "Roger, Bravo Delta, this is Sitting Duck."
Pilot 1 says: "I have bogey clean in my sights, and I’m, uh, gonna shoot bullets at it now."
The monster opens dozens of eyes all over its surface. A beam strikes the jet and blows it out of the sky, with the pilot bailing out.
Pilot 2 says: "Did you get him?"
The second jet is also blasted, and the creature floats away over the city. Cut to the crowd, looking up in terror.
Woman says: "I can’t believe it!"
Man 1 says: "I think this is the end!"
Man 2 says: "Ay-ay-ay!"
[Note says: "Read these lines out loud for full effect."
The girls fly in over their heads—Blossom in the lead, Bubbles and Buttercup behind her, smiling.
Blossom says: "I’m gonna teach you a lesson—"
Blossom says: "—"
Blossom says: "Mr."
Blossom says: "Evil Eye!"
Blossom says: "So, you think you can just roll into town and start vaporizing everything in sight?!"
Blossom says: "!"
Blossom says: "Well, look here, buddy, you can’t!"
[Animation goof says: "Buttercup is briefly seen in a pink dress during this sequence."
The screen is briefly filled with images of her—the world from the monster’s point of view.
Blossom says: "This is a happy and peaceful place—"

Blossom says: "—"
Blossom says: "and folks here don’t take kindly to this type of behavior."
Blossom says: "—"
Blossom says: "I’m gonna give you a chance to stop this senseless destruction, once and for all."
On each of these last four words, cut to an extreme close-up of a different part of her head. Pull back to show all three girls.
Blossom says: "So, champ—"
Blossom says: "—"
Blossom says: "what’s it gonna be?"
A pause, after which the monster begins to laugh— softly at first, then louder; with its eyes squeezed shut all along. Close-up of Blossom.
Blossom says: "What?"
The crowd on the ground also breaks into laughter.
Blossom says: "What?"
Her sisters are laughing again.
Blossom says: "What’s so funny?"
Bubbles says: "You!"
Buttercup says: "You!"
Blossom says: "Me?"
Blossom says: "But what’s so funny about—"
She cuts herself off, gasping in shock. Pan left slightly to show a building’s window, in which she sees her reflection for the first time since the World’s Worst Haircut. She screams in anguish and flees the scene.
Bubbles says: "Blossom, wait!"
Bubbles says: "It’s not that bad!"
The crowd continues to laugh along with them and the monster, which floats slowly down until it is behind the two girls. Suddenly all its eyes pop open, but it takes everyone a moment to notice this. The two turn around to face it just in time to get blasted into the pavement. They quickly climb out of their craters to attack again as the monster floats along, firing beams in all directions. It turns to face them and shoots them down again.
Overhead view of the street, with two holes side by side. The following three lines are delivered from inside them.
Buttercup says: "Bubbles…this isn’t working."
Buttercup says: "We need to—"
Bubbles says: "Try a sneak attack?"
Buttercup says: "Bingo!"
They take off in opposite directions. Bubbles removes the wrecking ball from a crane and takes cover among a group of buildings, waiting for the right moment to strike. She swings the ball on the end of its chain and prepares to heave it, only to have it blasted out of her hands. Buttercup flies to a water tank and tears it loose to use as a spear. As she closes in, the monster retreats behind a building and fires a beam, destroying the tank and spilling the water all over her.
Bubbles flies to a building and tears the spire from its roof; it is blown away before she can use it. Pull back slightly to show this scene framed on a TV screen, then cut to a newsroom. Stanley Whitfield is at the anchor desk, with a graphic of the monster and the words “Eye Carumba” displayed next to him.
Whitfield says: "This has been the scene all afternoon."
Side view of Blossom, sitting by herself in a darkened bedroom at home and watching the broadcast. She has a blanket pulled up around herself to hide her hair.
Whitfield says: "It seems the monster’s ability to see everything at all times has virtually eliminated any chance of attack by the Powerpuff Girls."
Whitfield says: "At this time, all we can do is wait for our tragic, inevitable doom."
Camera shifts to point at the open door. The Professor walks by and sees Blossom.
Whitfield says: "Boy, did she look stupid."
Professor says: "Blossom?"
Blossom says: "Go away!"
The end of the bed.
Professor says: "Are you okay?"
Blossom says: "I’m fine!"
Professor says: "You don’t sound fine to me."
Professor says: "Now come out from under there and show me a smile."
Blossom says: "No!"
Professor says: "Aw, come on, Blossom."
Professor says: "I bet it can’t be that bad."
She glares at him and removes the blanket, exposing her hair. He recoils in shock.
Professor says: "Whoa!"
Professor says: "I mean, uh…oh!"
Professor says: "You’ve…cut your hair?"
Blossom says: "No, Bubbles and Buttercup butchered it."
Blossom says: "And they and Townsville and even the monster all laughed at me."
Blossom says: "I’m never going outside again."
Camera shifts to behind the two; we see the other girls being blasted on TV.
Professor says: "But, Blossom, your sisters need your help."
Blossom says: "But everyone’ll laugh at me."
Professor says: "And that’s a bad thing?"
Professor says: "Blossom, you need to turn this hair-don’t—"
Professor says: "—"
Professor says: "into a hair-do."
Professor says: "Understand?"
She thinks for a moment, and her face suddenly brightens.
Blossom says: "Yes!"
Blossom says: "Thank you!"
After she is gone, he starts to snicker and snort, and finally dissolves into a gale of laughter.
In the city, the monster is again wiping out one building after another. Bubbles and Buttercup hide behind one only to have it destroyed a moment later. They take cover behind a school bus, then a pile of concrete blocks, then a STOP sign; each piece of cover is blown away. Bubbles’ pigtails try to beat their own retreat after the blocks go. Finally, they perch side by side on a pair of girders sticking out from a building under construction. A completed structure is next to them.
Buttercup says: "It’s no use!"
Buttercup says: "We can’t hide!"
Bubbles says: "Oh, no!"
Bubbles says: "Look!"
The building is vaporized, and the monster looms up over them and prepares to finish them off.
Narrator says: "Oh, myopia!"
Narrator says: "It looks like this is it for our girls!"
Narrator says: "Oh, I can’t bear to watch!"
Blossom says: "Hey, four-hundred-eyes!"
It grunts in surprise and turns its eyes to the left. Pan over to show Blossom hovering near it in all her ragged glory.
Blossom says: "What do you think?"
Blossom says: "Toupée or not toupée?"
Blossom says: "So, I went to the doctor to get some medicine."
Blossom says: "He said, “What’s the problem?"
Blossom says: "” And I said, “Doc, I have this terrible coif!"
The monster now roars with laughter, all its eyes squeezed shut; pan back to Bubbles and Buttercup on the girders. Buttercup is also laughing, but Bubbles is watching the whole situation intently.
Bubbles says: "Buttercup!"
Bubbles says: "Look!"
They see that the monster is off guard and nod to each other. Bubbles fires her eye lasers overhead, cutting a girder loose. Buttercup catches this, pulls it back over her shoulder, and swings with all her might. She connects, and the monster—still laughing—sails into outer space.
On the ground, the two girls join the laughing crowd. A moment later, Blossom lands next to them, looking quite tired of the whole situation.
Blossom says: "Okay, okay, I know."
Blossom says: "My hair looks stupid."
Buttercup says: "No, Blossom."
Buttercup says: "We’re laughing ’cause we’re happy."
Bubbles says: "Yeah."
Bubbles says: "We thought we were goners!"
Buttercup says: "But we’re all really sorry we laughed at you."
Bubbles says: "Yeah."
Blossom says: "Really?"
Blossom says: "But still, I do look really stupid!"
Buttercup says: "I’ll say!"
Buttercup says: "Stupid."
Bubbles says: "So we’re even?"
Blossom thinks for a moment; a wicked grin comes over her face. She fires her eye lasers at her sisters; close-up of them, their hair fried and their eyes wide open in shock.
Blossom says: "Yeah."
Blossom says: "We’re even."
Narrator says: "Who says justice is blind?"
The background for the end shot comes up.
Narrator says: "So once again the day is shaved—"
(The girls appear says: "Blossom on the left, laughing at an angry Buttercup and Bubbles on the right."
(The girls appear says: "All three are still sporting their mangled hairstyles."
(The girls appear says: ")"
Narrator says: "—"
Narrator says: "thanks to the Powerpuff Girls!"
